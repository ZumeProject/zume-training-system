"Zúme, the Greek word for ‘yeast,’ holds a significant meaning. In Matthew "
"13:33, Jesus compared the kingdom of heaven to yeast mixed into a large "

"In 2015, a small group committed to fulfilling Jesus’ Great Commission "
"mandate convened for a Jonathan Project Leadership Meeting. They prayed and "
"discussed the challenges in multiplying disciples around the world. "
"Recognizing the need for accessible, multilingual, and flexible training "
"that aligns with Jesus’ call for ordinary people to be ‘yeast’ for the "
"Kingdom, the idea for online video-based training was born. Ultimately, this "
