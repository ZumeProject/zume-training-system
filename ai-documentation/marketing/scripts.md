# (34) God Uses Ordinary People

**URL:** https://zume.training/en/app/script?s=34

Welcome to Zúme training. Zúme is the Greek word for "yeast."

Jesus tells us that the Kingdom of God is like a woman who took a small amount of "zúme" and put into a great amount of dough.

As she worked the yeast into the mix, it spread until all of the dough was leavened.

Jesus was showing us that an ordinary person can take something very small and use it to make an impact that's very big!

Our dream is to do what Jesus said -- to help ordinary people around the world use small tools to make a big impact in God's kingdom!

Jesus' final instructions to His followers were simple. He said — All authority in heaven and earth has been given to Me. Therefore — Go and Make Disciples of all nations Baptizing Them in the name of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit, Teaching them to obey all I have commanded, And I will be with you always - even to the end of the age.

Jesus' command was simple -- Make Disciples

His instructions on how to do that were simple -- Make disciples wherever you're going

Make disciples by baptizing them in the name of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit
Make disciples by teaching them to obey all He commanded
So what are the steps to make a disciple?

We make disciples all the time - wherever we're going and as we go
When someone decides to follow Jesus - they should be baptized
As they grow - we should teach every disciple how to obey everything that Jesus commanded.
Since one of the things He commanded is to make disciples, that means that every disciple who follows Jesus needs to learn how to make disciples too.

Those disciples are to make disciples. And those disciples are to make disciples, too.

Multiplying disciples. That's how Zúme works

It's like yeast - worked all through the dough until all of the dough is leavened.

When Jesus gave this command to go make disciples, He also gave a promise.

Jesus said - I will be with you always. Even to the very end of the age.

Every follower of Jesus should count on the promise that Jesus is always with us. Because He is!

But that also means every follower of Jesus should commit to the fact that Jesus wants each of us to make disciples. Because He does.

Jesus said - All authority in heaven and earth has been given to Me. Therefore go and make disciples.

The authority that Jesus relies on when He sends us -- is His authority.

Jesus says there is no authority higher than that. No tradition has more authority.

No culture has more authority. No law on earth has more authority.

Jesus said - Go and make disciples.

And like Zúme - like yeast - we'll keep going and growing until all the work is done.

# (35) Disciples and the Church

**URL:** https://zume.training/en/app/script?s=35

Welcome back to Zúme training. In this session, we'll talk about disciples and the church.

What is a disciple? And how do you make one?

How do you teach a follower of Jesus to obey all of His commands? How do you take someone who's lived their life as a captive of the world and equip them to become a citizen of God's kingdom?

The meaning of the word disciple is a follower. So a disciple is a follower of God. Jesus said - All authority in heaven and earth has been given to Me. So in God's kingdom, Jesus is our King. We are His citizens, subjects of His will. His desires, purposes, intentions, priorities and values are the highest and best. His Word is the law. So what is the law of the kingdom? What does Jesus tell His citizens to do?

Jesus said -- Love the Lord God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind and with all your strength. Jesus said -- Love your neighbor as yourself. Jesus said that God's commands from the Old Testament -- all the law and the prophets -- can be summarized in these two things -- Love God and Love People. Jesus said -- Make disciples. Jesus said -- Teach them to obey all that I've commanded.

Since making disciples includes teaching them all that Jesus commanded -- the New Testament can be summarized in this one thing -- Make Disciples.

A disciple is a follower of Jesus who Loves God, Loves People and Makes Disciples.

So what is a church?

You may be used to thinking of the church as a building - a place where you go. But God's Word talks about the church as a gathering - a people you belong to.

The word "church" is used in the Bible three different ways:

- the universal church -- all the people who were, are and will ever be followers of Jesus
- the city or regional church -- all the people who follow Jesus and live in or around a certain area of the world
- the church at home -- all the people who follow Jesus and meet where one or more of them live.

A spiritual family - followers of Jesus who Love God, Love People and Make Disciples and who meet together locally make up this last kind of church - the church at home or the simple church.

When groups of these simple churches connect to do something bigger, together, they can form a city or regional church.

All of those simple churches networked into regions and stretched across history make up the universal church.

THAT'S CHURCH WITH A CAPITAL "C"

Simple churches are spiritual families with Jesus as their center and their King. Simple churches are spiritual families who Love God, Love Others and Make Disciples who Multiply. Some churches have Buildings and Programs and Budgets and Staff. But simple churches don't need any of these things in order to Love God, Love Others and Make Disciples who Multiply. And since anything extra makes a church more complicated and harder to multiply, our training leaves things like Buildings and Programs and Budgets and Staff to the city or regional church built from multiplying simple churches.

Remember "zúme" means "yeast" -- a simple, single cell organism that reproduces quickly.

With Zúme training - we're going to be like that yeast - simple and multiplying. But before we start multiplying - let's make sure we know what God wants reproduced. Because multiplication can be good - but not always. Cancer is multiplication. And it's deadly. So how do we reproduce life and not death? And how do we make sure we're disciples worth reproducing?

# (36) Spiritual Breathing Script

**URL:** https://zume.training/en/app/script?s=36

Welcome back to Zúme training. In this session, we'll talk about hearing from God and obeying what we hear.

Breathing is life. We breathe in. We breathe out. Life.

Breathing is just as important in God's Kingdom. In fact, God calls His Spirit - "breath".

In the Kingdom, we breathe IN when we HEAR from God. We breathe in when we HEAR from God through HIS WORD - the Bible. We breathe in when we HEAR from God through PRAYER - our conversations with Him. We breathe in when we HEAR from God through HIS BODY - the church, other followers of Jesus. We breathe in when we HEAR from God through HIS WORKS - the events, experiences and sometimes even the persecutions and sufferings He allows His children to go through.

In the Kingdom we breathe OUT when we ACT on what we hear from God. We breathe OUT when we OBEY.

Sometimes breathing out to OBEY means changing our thoughts, our words or our actions to bring them into alignment with Jesus and His will.

Sometimes breathing out to OBEY means sharing what Jesus has shared with us - giving away what He gave us - so that others can be blessed just as God is blessing us.

For a follower of Jesus - this breathing IN and breathing OUT is critical. It's our very life. Jesus said - the Son can do nothing by himself. He does only what he sees the Father doing. Whatever the Father does, the Son also does.

Jesus said - I don't speak on my own authority. The Father who sent me has commanded me what to say and how to say it.

Jesus said that every word He spoke and every work He accomplished was based on HEARING from God and OBEYING what He heard.

Breathe IN - Hear from God. Breathe OUT - Obey what you hear and share it with others.

Jesus said that His followers would also hear from God because of His Holy Spirit - His Breath - that would be breathed into every one of us who follows Him.

Jesus said - the Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, will teach you all things and remind you of everything that I have told you.

Breathe IN - Hear from God. Breathe OUT - Obey what you hear and share it with others.

Jesus was showing us how to live.

So how do we hear God's voice? How do we know what to obey?

Jesus called Himself "The Good Shepherd". Jesus called His followers His "sheep". Jesus said - My sheep hear My voice, and I know them, and they follow Me. Jesus said - Whoever belongs to God hears what God says. The reason you do not hear is that you do not belong to God.

As followers of Jesus, we have to be committed to hearing His voice.

We HEAR His voice by being still.
We HEAR His voice by focusing on Jesus.
We HEAR His voice in our thoughts, our visions, our feelings and impressions.
We HEAR His voice when we write down and test what we hear.

Not every voice, not every thought, not every vision, feeling or impression is God's voice. Sometimes it is the voice of the enemy. Jesus said our enemy is a liar and the father of lies. Jesus said our enemy comes to steal, kill and destroy.

But God says that we WILL hear from Him and we will know it is Him when He speaks. With practice and prayer, we can know God's voice better. We can learn to know whether what we hear is from God or another voice.

Here are some ways to test what we hear:

- When Jesus speaks - His voice will always be consistent with what His Written Word - The Bible - has already told us. His spoken voice will never contradict His written voice.
- When Jesus speaks - His voice will give our hearts a sense of hope and peace. His voice will not leave us condemned or discouraged. Jesus does not condemn. Jesus corrects in love.
- Jesus's voice will not express the works of the flesh - sexual immorality and impurity, debauchery, idolatry and witchcraft, hatred and discord, jealousy and fits of rage, selfish ambitions, dissensions, factions and envy, drunkenness and orgies. These things are not from God's voice.
- When Jesus speaks - His voice will express the fruit of God's Spirit - love and joy, peace and patience, kindness and goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control.
- When Jesus speaks - His voice gives us a sense of confidence instead of doubt. We experience inside ourselves a knowledge and peace that what we're hearing is from God. We may not hear everything at once. We may hear only part of what we eventually will need to know. But what we hear will be solid - not shifting or changing.

The good news for every follower of Jesus is that when we breathe IN and HEAR from God and when we breathe OUT and OBEY what we hear and SHARE with others what we've heard - God will speak even more clearly.

His breath will breathe through us even more.

We will HEAR His voice more clearly. We will KNOW His voice and not another's. We will SEE His work in the world and be able to join in and work with Him.

We breathe in. We breathe out. Life.

# (37) S.O.A.P.S. Script

**URL:** https://zume.training/en/app/script?s=37

Jesus said -- "make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit and teaching them to obey all I that I commanded…"

If every follower of Jesus is going to obey all that Jesus commanded, then they need to know what Jesus commands.

The Great Commandment and The Great Commission are a great summary of what God has to say to us, but if a follower is going to grow into the full measure of what God created them to be, then they need to know and obey even more.

SOAPS stands for:

- **Scripture**
- **Observation**
- **Application**
- **Prayer**
- **Sharing**

It's a simple way to learn and remember an effective Bible study method that any follower of Jesus can use. Let's look at each section a little more.

When you read or listen to the Bible:

**Scripture:** Write out one or more verses that are particularly meaningful to you, today.

**Observation:** Rewrite those verses or key points from those scriptures in your own words to help you better understand the meaning.

**Application:** Think about what it means to obey these commands or concepts in your own life. What would you have to do? What would you have to do differently? Write these down.

**Prayer:** Write out a prayer that tells God what you've read in His word and what you understand about obeying His commands and putting what you've learned to work.

**Sharing:** Ask God who He wants you to share with about what you've learned and how you're applying it.

So let's put SOAPS to work:

**Scripture** - The Bible says -- "For my thoughts are not your thoughts, nor are your ways My ways," declares the Lord. "For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are My ways higher than your ways and My thoughts than your thoughts." Isaiah 55:8-9.

**Observation** - As a human, I'm limited in what I know and what I know how to do. God is not limited in any way. He sees and knows everything. He can do anything.

**Application** - Since God knows everything and His ways are best, I'll have much more success in life if I follow Him instead of relying on my way of doing things.

**Prayer** - Lord, I don't know how to live a good life that pleases you and helps others. My ways lead to mistakes. My thoughts lead to hurt. Please teach me Your ways and Your thoughts, instead. Let Your Holy Spirit guide me as I follow You.

**Sharing** - I will share these verses and this application with my friend, Steve, who is going through a difficult time and needs direction for important decisions he's facing.

SOAPS Bible Study. One of the simple tools in the Zúme Toolkit.

# (38) Accountability Groups Script

**URL:** https://zume.training/en/app/script?s=38

Jesus said - "From everyone who has been given much, much will be demanded; and from the one who has been entrusted with much, much more will be asked."

Jesus shared many stories of accountability and told us many truths of how we will be held responsible for what we do and say.

Jesus tells us these things now, so we can be ready for later. And because we will be accountable to him one day, it's good to practice being accountable to one another now.

Accountability Groups are made up of two or three people of the same gender - men with men, women with women - who meet once a week to discuss a set of questions that help reveal areas where things are going right and other areas that need correction.

Every follower of Jesus will be held accountable, so every follower of Jesus should practice accountability with others.

Accountability Groups. Another simple tool in the Zúme Toolkit.

# (39) Producers vs Consumers Script

**URL:** https://zume.training/en/app/script?s=39

In this session, we'll talk about how we can help a follower of Jesus become a PRODUCER in God's kingdom instead of simply a CONSUMER.

In His perfect plan, God created us to live in balance - to PRODUCE and to CONSUME, to CREATE and to USE UP, to POUR OUT and to be FILLED so we can POUR OUT again. But, in our broken world, people have rejected God's plan, and many spend their energy living out just part of God's perfect equation. They LEARN but they don't share. They are FILLED UP but they never pour out. They CONSUME but they don't produce.

If we're going to make disciples who multiply, then we need to share with them how they can be producers and not just consumers.

Here's how — God uses His Written Word - which we call Scripture or The Bible - to grow us spiritually.

Every disciple needs to be equipped to learn, interpret and apply Scripture. Over thousands of years and through many different authors, God spoke His word into the hearts of faithful men who captured and shared what they heard. The Scriptures teach us God's story, His plans, His heart, His ways.

In an earlier session, you learned two simple tools - SOAPS Bible Study and Accountability Groups. In an upcoming session, you'll learn one more simple tool - 3/3rds Groups. These three tools work together to help equip new followers to learn, interpret and apply God's Written Word. They will learn not to be just hearers of God's word but doers and sharers, also.

God also uses His Spoken Word - which we can discern through Prayer - to grow us spiritually. Prayer is speaking and listening to God. Prayer helps us know God more intimately and understand His heart, His will and His ways. Prayer helps us minister and serve others, helps us teach and share in specific ways that helps individuals or a group know God better.

Two simple tools - Prayer Walking and The Prayer Cycle help followers develop a personal prayer life and learn to pray in ways that serve others. These tools help develop a habit of praying without ceasing and learning to see the world from a spiritual perspective instead of only relying on what we can visibly see.

When used consistently, they help a follower of Jesus, increase their capacity for prayer and enhance their ability to hear from God and share what they hear.

God uses His Body of Believers - which we call The Church or the Followers of Jesus - to grow us spiritually. As the gathering of believers, we are connected. God's Word says that in Jesus - we are many parts of one body, and we all belong to each other. In other words, we're not just connected to God - we're connected with each other. God says to submit to one another. God says to serve one another. Each of us has different strengths and each has weaknesses. God expects us to use our strengths to help others who may be weak. And He expects us to allow others to help us in our weakness using the strengths He has given them.

God's Word says God has given each of you some special abilities; be sure to use them to help each other, passing on to others God's many kinds of blessings. Simple tools like 3/3rds Groups, Accountability Groups and Peer Mentoring help us encourage one another to love and good works by not only helping us to obey what God tells us to do but also helping us find ways to share what we learn with others.

God also uses Persecution and Suffering - sacrifice and loss that we suffer on behalf of Jesus - to grow us spiritually. When people oppress and hurt us because we love and obey Jesus, or when bad things happen even though we love and obey Jesus, God uses those persecutions and sufferings to refine our character and make us more like Jesus. He develops our character, strengthens and purifies our faith, equips for ministry and allows us to serve others who are suffering in a special way - all while making Himself known more clearly to everyone who watches us and knows our pain. God tells us that as followers of Jesus we should expect to be persecuted.

Jesus said - God will bless you when people insult you, mistreat you, and tell all kinds of evil lies about you because of me. Be happy and excited! You will have a great reward in heaven. People did these same things to the prophets who lived long ago.

Simple tools like 3/3rds Groups and Accountability Groups give followers of Jesus an opportunity to share the persecutions and sufferings they experience.

These groups give you a chance to teach disciples that God's word says we should expect hard times and to equip them in how to respond well by trusting God's love even when things go wrong.

Scripture. Prayer. Body Life. Persecution and Suffering. These are all ways that God grows us to be more like His perfect Son, Jesus.

Simple tools help us not to just be consumers of these good things that God has given us but to be producers and sharers as well.

# (40) Prayer Cycle Script

**URL:** https://zume.training/en/app/script?s=40

Jesus often taught His followers about the purpose, the practice and the promises of prayer.

Jesus said - "Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you. For everyone who asks receives; he who seeks finds; and to him who knocks, the door will be opened."

Jesus taught His followers that prayer isn't for public praise, a selfish wishlist or a rambling speech we repeat over and over again.

Jesus showed us prayer has power because it's a direct and ongoing conversation with our Father in heaven who loves us. Like any good conversation, a good prayer means both sides get to listen -- and speak. But speaking to the God who created the universe can seem intimidating. And actually hearing something back - well for most people that can be downright scary.

The good news is that getting better at prayer - having better and deeper conversations with a God who loves us - is not only possible - it's exactly what God wants.

But when prayer feels like learning a new language - how do you get better? The answer is simple - you practice. The Prayer Cycle is a simple tool for practicing prayer that you can use by yourself and share with any follower.

In just 12 simple steps - 5 minutes each - the Prayer Cycle guides you through twelve ways the Bible teaches us to pray. At the end, you'll have prayed for an hour. The Bible tells us -- "Pray without ceasing." Not many of us can say we do that. But after this hour of prayer - you'll be a step closer.

The Prayer Cycle - One more simple tool in the Zúme Toolkit.

# (41) List of 100 Script

**URL:** https://zume.training/en/app/script?s=41

Jesus said - "Go and make disciples…" And His followers did just that.

They went to their family. They went to their friends. They went to people they knew in town. They went to people they worked with. They went.

Jesus said "Go" and they obeyed. And God's family grew.

God has already given us the relationships we need to "Go and make disciples." These are our family, friends, neighbors, co-workers and classmates - people we've known all our lives, people we've just met.

Being faithful with the people God has already put in our lives is a great first step in multiplying disciples. And it can start with the simple step of making a list.

A List of 100 is a simple tool in the Zúme Toolkit that multiplies disciples.

# (42) Spiritual Economy Script

**URL:** https://zume.training/en/app/script?s=42

In this session, we'll talk about God's SPIRITUAL ECONOMY. In this broken world, people feel rewarded when they take, when they receive and when they gain more than those around them.

In His Scriptures, God tells His people - My thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways My ways. God shows us in His Kingdom economy we're rewarded not by what we get - but by what we give away. God says - I will save you, and you will be a blessing. Jesus said - It is better to give than to receive. Giving away what God gives us and blessing others when God blesses us is the foundation for the SPIRITUAL BREATHING we learned about before. We breathe IN and HEAR from God. We breathe OUT and OBEY what we hear and SHARE with others.

When we are faithful to OBEY and SHARE what the Lord has shared with us, then He promises to share even more. Jesus said - Whoever can be trusted with very little can also be trusted with much.

This is the path to deeper insights, greater intimacy and living the abundant life God created us to live. This is the way we can walk in the good works God has already planned for us to do. If we want to be rewarded with God's greatest reward, then we have to practice the two things that He promises to bless.

We must —

- OBEY and SHARE
- DO and TEACH
- PRACTICE and PASS ON

— everything that God tells us to do.

If we want others to receive God's greatest reward, then we have to show them how to do the same thing, too. This is a major part of being a disciple and a major part of making disciples.

We are FOLLOWERS and LEADERS
We are LEARNERS and TEACHERS
We are BLESSED and we are a BLESSING

God doesn't want us to wait until we know everything before we start obeying and sharing. That day will never come. God doesn't expect us to be fully mature before we start multiplying. He wants us to multiply right away.

God wants us to obey what we already know and to share what we've already heard. And then He wants us to teach others to do the same. After all - that's obeying and sharing what He's already told us to do. This is the path to maturity and growth.

# (43) The Gospel Script

**URL:** https://zume.training/en/app/script?s=43

In this session, we'll learn how to share GOD'S STORY - The Gospel - from Creation to Judgement, from the beginning of humankind to the end of this age. There are many ways to share God's story.

The best way will depend on the person you're sharing with and their view of the world and their life experiences.

God uses hearts willing to share to work on hearts willing to hear.

It's His work. He just invites us to join in.

One way to share God's Story is by explaining what's happened from God's Creation to His Judgement at the end of this age. When we tell God's story in this way, we can make it long or short, detailed or just broad strokes but always connected to the culture of the one who hears. To help tell His Story across different cultures and world views, you can also use hand motions that make it easier to learn and teach.

Here is God's Story of Good News -

In the beginning, God made the whole world and everything in it. He created the FIRST MAN and the FIRST WOMAN. He placed them in a beautiful garden. He made them PART OF HIS FAMILY and had a CLOSE RELATIONSHIP with them. He created them to LIVE FOREVER. There was no such thing as death. Even in this perfect place, man rebelled against God and brought SIN and SUFFERING into the world. God BANISHED man from the garden. The relationship between man and God was BROKEN. Now man would have to face DEATH.

Over many hundreds of years, God kept sending MESSENGERS into the world. They reminded man of his sin but also told him of God's FAITHFULNESS and PROMISE to send a SAVIOR into the world.

The Savior would RESTORE the close relationship between God and Man. The Savior would RESCUE man from death. The Savior would give ETERNAL LIFE and be with man forever.

God loves us so much that when the time was right, He sent His Son into the world to be that Savior. Jesus was God's Son. He was born into the world through a virgin. He lived a perfect life. He never sinned.

Jesus taught people about God. He performed many miracles showing His great power. He cast out many demons. He healed many people. He made the blind see. He made the deaf hear. He made the lame walk. Jesus even raised the dead. Many religious leaders were THREATENED and JEALOUS of Jesus. They wanted Him killed.

Since He never sinned, Jesus did not have to die. But He CHOSE to die as a SACRIFICE for all of us. His painful death covered up the sins of mankind. After this, Jesus was buried in a tomb. God saw the SACRIFICE Jesus made and accepted it. God showed His acceptance by raising Jesus from the dead on the third day.

God said that if we BELIEVE and RECEIVE Jesus' sacrifice for our sins -- If we TURN AWAY from our sins and FOLLOW Jesus, God CLEANS US from all sin and WELCOMES us back into His family.

God sends the HOLY SPIRIT to live inside us and make us able to follow Jesus. We are BAPTIZED in water to show and seal this restored relationship. As a symbol of death we are buried beneath the water. As a symbol of new life we are raised out of the water to follow Jesus. When Jesus rose from the dead, He spent 40 days on earth.

Jesus taught His followers to go everywhere and tell the good news of His salvation to everyone around the world. Jesus said - Go and MAKE DISCIPLES of all nations, BAPTIZING them in the name of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit; and TEACHING them to obey all I have commanded. I will be with you always - even to the end of this age.

Jesus was then TAKEN UP before their eyes into heaven. One day, Jesus will COME AGAIN in the same way He left. He will PUNISH FOREVER those who did not love and obey Him. He will RECEIVE and REWARD FOREVER those who did love and obey Him. We will LIVE FOREVER with Him in a New Heaven and on a New Earth.

I BELIEVED and RECEIVED the sacrifice Jesus made for my sins. He has made me clean and restored me as part of God's family. He loves me, and I love Him and will live with Him forever in His kingdom.

God loves you and wants you to receive this gift, as well. Would you like to do that right now?

# (44) Baptism Script

**URL:** https://zume.training/en/app/script?s=44

Jesus said -- "go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit…"

Baptism - or "Baptizo" in the original language - means a drenching or submerging - like when you dye a cloth and it soaks in the color and comes out transformed.

Baptism is a picture of our new life, soaked in the image of Jesus, transformed in obedience to God. It is a picture of our death to sin, just as Jesus died for our sins; a burial of our old way of life, just as Jesus was buried; a rebirth to a new life in Christ, just as Jesus was resurrected and lives today.

If you have never baptized someone before, it may seem intimidating, but it shouldn't be. Here are some simple steps. Find some standing water, deep enough to allow the new disciple to be submerged. This could be a pond, river, lake or ocean. It could be a bathtub or another way to gather water.

Let the disciple hold one of your hands with theirs and support their back with the other.

Ask two questions like these to make sure they understand their decision.

"Do you believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God and that He died for your sins and rose from the dead?"
"Will you obey and serve Him as your King for the rest of your life?"

If they answer "Yes," to both, then say something like this:

"Because you've professed your faith in the Lord Jesus, I now baptize you in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit."

Help them lower into the water, submerge completely and raise them back up.

You've baptized a new follower of Jesus - a new citizen of heaven - a new child of the Living God. It's time to celebrate!

Baptism - the first sacrament Jesus gave His followers and a foundation of the Zúme Toolkit.

# (45) 3 Minute Testimony Script

**URL:** https://zume.training/en/app/script?s=45

Jesus told His followers - "You are witnesses of these things." As followers of Jesus, we are "witnesses", too - "testifying" about the impact Jesus has had on our lives. Your story of your relationship with God is called your testimony. Everybody has a story. This is a chance to practice yours.

Choose one or two followers to practice with and then pick 5 names from your List of 100. Make sure you choose people in the category "non-Christian" or "unknown spiritual status." Practice your testimony - your story of Jesus - by having your practice partners pretend to be 1 of the 5 people you chose from your list. Practice shaping your story to make it specific for each of the 5. You should be able to share a short version of your story in about three minutes.

There are endless ways to shape your story, but here are some ways that we've seen work well with others: You can share a simple statement about why you chose to follow Jesus. This works well for a brand new believer. You can share your "before" and "after" story - what your life was like before you knew Jesus and what your life your life is like now. Simple and powerful.

You can share your "with" and "without" story what your life is like "with Jesus" and what it would be like "without Him". This version of your story works well if you came to faith at a young age.

When you finish sharing, let your practice partner take their turn. Keep going back and forth until you've both finished your five. Want to make an even greater impact?

When sharing your story, it's helpful to think of it as part of a three-part process:

- **Their story** - Ask the person you are talking with to share about their spiritual journey.
- **Your story** - Then share your testimony shaped around their experience.
- **God's story** - Finally share God's story in a way that connects with their worldview, values and priorities.

And if you're worried about how to get started - keep it simple.

Just share a statement of why you decided to follow Jesus. God can use your story to change lives, but remember - you're the one who gets to tell it.

Your Three-Minute Testimony is another simple tool in the Zúme Toolkit.

# (46) Greatest Blessing Script

**URL:** https://zume.training/en/app/script?s=46

In this session, we'll talk about God's GREAT, GREATER and GREATEST BLESSINGS and how you can share them with others. When someone chooses to follow Jesus, how do you help them move down the right path? How do you help them become a producer in God's kingdom and not just another consumer? How do you help them receive all the blessings that God is willing to give?

I start by telling them this…

It is a blessing to follow Jesus.
It is a great blessing to lead others to follow Jesus.
It is a greater blessing to start a new spiritual family.
It is the greatest blessing to equip others to start new spiritual families.

You have chosen to follow Jesus and so God has blessed you. I want you to have God's great blessing, greater blessing and greatest blessing, too. Can I show you how?

If they want to know more, I ask them to make a list of 100 people they already know. Then I ask them to choose five people from that list - five people who do not know Jesus - five people they want to share with right away.

It is a blessing to follow Jesus. Who else do you want to share this blessing with?

I teach them to share their TESTIMONY - the story of what God is doing in their life. I teach them to share the GOSPEL - the story of what God is doing in the world. I teach them how to share about God's great, greater and greatest blessings.

I have them practice these things one time for each of the five people they've chosen to share with. First their story. Then God's story. Then God's blessings. Each time, I pretend to be one of the five people from their list. Each time, they share their story. They share God's story. They invite me to become a follower of Jesus, too. They teach about God's great, greater and greatest blessing. Each time, I ask them questions or make comments that I think that person might make. After we've practiced, I ask to meet them again - just two days later if possible - to see how this sharing is going.

I want to give them enough time to meet with the five from their list, but I don't want to give so much time that they put it off or forget.

I always ask for a phone number or email address or another way to keep in touch. I pray with them that God will give the right words just as they've shared with me.

Two days later, we meet again and talk about how the sharing is going.

If they haven't shared, I offer to practice with them more. I offer to go with them right then to any of the five who might be available. I do everything I can to help them begin sharing. But I won't talk about new things. I want to give them the best opportunity to be faithful with what they've already learned.

If they refuse or make excuses, I ask God if this is really "good soil" that will be fruitful for His kingdom or if there is somewhere else where I should be investing.

If they shared - we celebrate!

Even if none on their list believed, I'm excited that they HEARD, OBEYED and SHARED. That's being faithful. And since they've been faithful with a little, I'm glad to share more.

I share about BAPTISM and give them another tool they can use like ____ or _____ ask them to choose some other people from their list of 100 - people who don't know or don't follow Jesus.

And then I practice with them - just like before - with their story, with God's story and with God's blessings. And we pray. Now if they shared AND someone on their list believed, we really CELEBRATE!

God's family is getting bigger! I always ask if they shared about the great, greater and greatest blessing, because this is what keeps God's family growing.

If they didn't share about God's blessings, we go over it again -- the blessings, how a new follower of Jesus can make a list, how they can share their story, share God's story and share the blessings -- all so that new follower of Jesus can learn share, too.

After we've practiced, I send them back to that new believer so they can continue sharing. But what about those who have shared AND someone on their list believed AND they shared the blessings?

When that happens I am OVERJOYED.

This person is what God's word calls "good soil" -- someone who may grow God's family in ways that are greater than I've ever seen! Whenever I find someone like this, I make plans to meet with them often. I invest heavily in their spiritual development.

I share new lessons like BAPTISM and how to start a THREE-THIRDS GROUP. Now they can begin to grow a spiritual family - starting with those same new followers of Jesus.

Since they are so faithful, I'm excited to share as much as I can and see what God does next. Always a step at a time. Always giving them a chance to LEARN, OBEY and SHARE what they know.

I also pray for this person - as often as I can - thanking God for allowing me to share and learn with them and always asking Him to give them His GREATEST BLESSING.

# (50) Prayer Walking Script

**URL:** https://zume.training/en/app/script?s=50

God's Word says that we should "petition, pray, intercede and give thanksgiving for all people, for kings and all those in authority -- that we may live peaceful and quiet lives in all godliness and holiness. This is good, and pleases God our Savior, who wants all people to be saved and to come to a knowledge of the truth."

Prayer Walking is a simple way to obey God's command to pray for others. Prayer Walking is just what it sounds like - praying to God while walking around.

Instead of closing our eyes and bowing our heads, we keep our eyes open to the needs we see around us and bow our hearts to ask humbly for God to intervene. You can prayer walk in small groups of two or three or you can prayer walk by yourself.

If you go in a group - try having everyone pray out loud, a conversation with God about what everyone is seeing and the needs that God brings to their hearts.

If you go by yourself - pray silently or out loud if you pray with someone you meet along the way.

Here are four ways you can know what to pray for during your prayer walk:

- **Observation** -- What do you see? If you see a child's toy in a yard, you might be prompted to pray for the neighborhood's children, for families or for schools in the area.
- **Research** -- What do you know? If you've read up about the neighborhood, you might know something about the people who live there, or if the area suffers from crime or injustice. Pray about these things and ask God to act.
- **Revelation** -- The Holy Spirit may nudge your heart or bring an idea to mind for a particular need or area of prayer. Listen - and pray!
- **Scripture** - You may have read part of God's Word in preparation for your walk or as you walk, the Holy Spirit may bring a Scripture to mind. Pray about that passage and how it might impact the people in that area.

Here are five areas of influence that you can focus on during your prayer walk:

- **Government** - Look for and pray over Government centers such as courthouses, commission buildings or law enforcement offices. Pray for the area's protection, for justice and for godly wisdom for its leaders.
- **Business and Commerce** - Look for and pray over Commercial centers such as financial districts or shopping area. Pray for righteous investments and good stewardship of resources. Pray for economic justice and opportunity and for generous and godly givers who put people before profits.
- **Education** - Look for and pray over Educational centers such as schools and administration buildings, vocational training centers, community colleges and universities. Pray for righteous educators to teach God's truth and protect the minds of their students. Pray that God would intervene in every effort to promote lies or confusion. Pray that these places would send out wise citizens who have a heart to serve and lead.
- **Communication** - Look for and pray over Communication centers such as radio stations, tv stations and newspaper publishers. Pray for God's Story and the testimony of His followers to be spread throughout the city and around the world. Pray that His message is delivered through His medium to His multitudes and that God's people everywhere will see God's work.
- **Spirituality** - Look for and pray over Spiritual centers such as church buildings, mosques or temples. Pray that every spiritual seeker would find peace and comfort in Jesus and not be distracted or confused by any false religion.

Finally, here are five ways you can pray for people you meet during your prayer walk:

As you walk and pray, be alert for opportunities and listen for promptings by God's Spirit to pray for individuals and groups you meet along the way. You can say, "We're praying for this community, is there anything in particular we can pray for you about?" Or say, "I'm praying for this area. Do you know anything in particular we should pray for?" After listening to their response you can ask about their own needs. If they share, pray for them right away. If the Lord leads, you may pray about other needs as well.

Use the word BLESS to help you remember 5 different ways you can pray:

- **B**ody (health)
- **L**abor (job and finances)
- **E**motional (morale)
- **S**ocial (relationships)
- **S**piritual

In most cases, people are grateful you care enough to pray.

If the person is not a Christian, your prayer may open the door to a spiritual conversation and an opportunity to share your story and God's story. You can invite them to be a part of a Bible study or even host one in their home.

If the person is a Christian you can invite them to join your prayer walk or train them how they can prayerwalk and use simple steps like praying for areas of influence or the BLESS prayer to grow God's family even more.

Prayer Walking - another simple tool in the Zúme toolkit.

# (51) Person of Peace Script

**URL:** https://zume.training/en/app/script?s=51

Welcome back to Zúme Training. In an earlier session you were introduced to the idea of a Person of Peace. In this session we'll go into more detail about who that person might be and how to know when you've found one.

A Person of Peace can help rapidly reproduce disciple-making even in a place where followers of Jesus are few and far between.

When Jesus sent out His disciples to new territory to make disciples, He gave them a simple but strategic command.

Jesus said -- Carry no money belt, no bag, no shoes; greet no one on the way. Whatever house you enter, first say, 'Peace be to this house.' If a man of peace is there, your peace will rest on him; but if not, it will return to you. Stay in that same house, eating and drinking what they give you; for the laborer is worthy of his wages. Do not keep moving from house to house.

But what does all that mean?

When we think of making disciples, our first thought might be -- We better get our finances in order, pick an obvious target, and have a clear plan of action. If Jesus said - "Go", we better "go" and keep on going! Tell Everyone! Everywhere!! All the time!!!

But Jesus, in His instructions, seemed a lot less worried about finances and fervor, and a lot more concerned about focus. Jesus wanted His disciples looking for - and investing in - a Person of Peace.

When you want to make disciples in a place where not many - or maybe even any - exist, then looking for a Person of Peace might be the most important thing you do.

A Person of Peace is:

- Someone who is **OPEN** to hearing Your Story, God's Story and the Good News of Jesus.
- Someone who is **HOSPITABLE** and **WELCOMES** you into their home or their workplace or to join events with family and friends.
- Someone who **KNOWS OTHERS** (or is **KNOWN BY OTHERS**) and who is excited to draw together a small group or even a crowd.
- Someone who is **FAITHFUL** and **SHARES** what they learn with others - even after you're gone.

In the Bible, we learn of Jesus and His followers meeting Persons of Peace that are a little - unexpected.

In the region of the Gadarenes, Jesus met a demon-possessed man who lived isolated and in chains. We would never think of Him as a Person of Peace, but He was OPEN to hear from Jesus. He was HOSPITABLE and WELCOMED Jesus to where He lived. He was WELL KNOWN and could easily draw a crowd - even if only for his outrageous behavior.

And Jesus found that he was FAITHFUL and SHARED what Jesus meant to him with his family, his community and his whole country. In fact, when Jesus came back to that area, a great crowd gathered, excited to see the Man they had heard so much about.

In Samaria, Jesus met a woman at a well. She was OPEN to Jesus, willing to be HOSPITABLE and answer His request for a drink. We learn she had five husbands and was living with still another man, and so in a small town, she was sure to be KNOWN BY OTHERS. And after Jesus spoke to her, she was FAITHFUL and SHARED - so much and so quickly that the entire town asked Jesus to stay and share with them, too. And He did.

So, if a Person of Peace can live almost anywhere, do almost anything, and be almost anyone we know or meet - how do we find one?

Here are three simple ways --

- We **ASK** for recommendations from people in the community - Who's someone that's trusted here? Is there someone in this place who thinks of others before themselves? If we hear the same name again and again - we try to meet them, share spiritual ideas, and see if they're open to hear and share.
- We **OFFER** to pray for someone while Prayer Walking, or at work, or at the game - wherever there's an opportunity - and then turn that prayer into a spiritual conversation.
- We **INTRODUCE** spiritual ideas into every conversation to see if God is working in a person's life. If they are open and willing, then we ask if they would be willing to gather a group to discuss even more.

ASK for recommendations, OFFER to pray, INTRODUCE spiritual ideas. These are all ways we can begin the process of finding a Person of Peace.

And no matter how we find them, remember Jesus said a Person of Peace is someone we should be spending most of our disciple-making time with.

It's easy to think that the most "fair" use of our time is to give away a little bit of ourselves to everyone, equally. But Jesus said - and showed - that He doesn't want us to be shallow with everyone but to give deeply to a few.

Jesus often attracted crowds, but the Bible tells us again and again that Jesus would draw away from those crowds to spend most of His time with just twelve of His closest followers.

There were a number of times, where Jesus would invest even more time with a smaller group of just three.

If Jesus, who had much more power, much more energy, much more authority, discipline, wisdom, knowledge, understanding and compassion chose to spend His time investing deeply in just a few and told His own disciples to do the same, doesn't it make sense that we should follow and share His perfect pattern?

A Person of Peace.

They're not easy to find - maybe one in a thousand. But like a hidden treasure that's worth the search, their value in growing God's family can't be measured.

# (52) Faithfulness Script

**URL:** https://zume.training/en/app/script?s=52

In this session, we'll learn how FAITHFULNESS is a much better measure of spiritual maturity than knowledge and training. There are two ideas that have caused a number of problems in the church, today.

The first is the idea that someone's spiritual maturity is connected to how much they know about God's Word. They act as if RIGHT BELIEF - or orthodoxy - is a good measure of someone's faith.

The second is the idea that someone's ability to lead requires a "full training" before they begin in ministry. They act as if COMPLETE KNOWLEDGE - is a good measure of someone's ability to serve.

The problem with the first idea - relying on ORTHODOXY - or "right belief" is that Satan, himself, knows more scripture than any human. GOD'S WORD says - You believe that there is one God.

Good! Even the demons believe that--and shudder.

A better measure of someone's spiritual maturity is ORTHOPRAXY - "right practice". We should be much more concerned with FAITHFULNESS in OBEYING and SHARING than measuring maturity based only on what we know.

The problem with the second idea - that someone must be fully trained before they lead is that no one of is ever fully trained.

Jesus modeled sending out young leaders who still had many things to learn to do some of the most important work in the Kingdom.

God's Word says - Jesus called together his twelve apostles and gave them complete power over all demons and diseases. Then he sent them to tell about God's kingdom and to heal the sick.

These men were sent before Peter shared his belief that Jesus was Savior - something we'd consider a first step of faith. And even after being sent Jesus rebuked Peter multiple times for mistakes and Peter would still later deny Jesus, completely. Other followers argued over who was the greatest and what role each would play in God's future Kingdom.

They all still had a lot to learn but Jesus put them to work sharing what they already knew.

Faithfulness - more than knowledge - is something that can start as soon someone begins to follow Jesus.

Faithfulness - more than training - is something that can be measured by what we do with what we've been given.

If we OBEY and SHARE what we hear with others, we are faithful.

If we hear but we REFUSE to obey and share, we are unfaithful.

As we multiply disciples, let's make sure we're measuring the right things.

# (53) 3/3 Groups Script

**URL:** https://zume.training/en/app/script?s=53

Welcome back to Zúme Training. In this session, we'll learn how a 3/3 (NOTE: PRONOUNCE AS "Three-Thirds") Group is a method of meeting that helps followers of Jesus help one another follow Jesus more closely.

Jesus said -- "where two or three have gathered together in My name, I am there in their midst." That's a powerful promise, and one that every follower of Jesus should take advantage of. But when you come together as a group, how should you spend your time?

A 3/3 (NOTE: PRONOUNCE AS "Three-Thirds") Group is one that divides their time together into 3 parts, so that they can practice obeying some of the most important things that Jesus commands.

This is how it works:

- **Look Back (VISUAL - 1/3)** The first third of the group's time is spent looking back at what's happened since we've been together.
- **Look Up (VISUAL - 2/3)** The middle third of the group's time is spent Looking Up for God's wisdom and direction through scripture, discussion and prayer.
- **Look Forward (VISUAL - 3/3)** The final third of the group's time is spent Looking Forward to how we can each apply and obey what we've learned.

In this session your group will be guided through a SHORT version of a 3/3 group to help prepare you for a FULL version in real life. Remember the session on spiritual breathing? Breathe in, hear from God. Breathe out, obey what you hear and share it with others. That's what a 3/3rds group is all about. A 3/3 Group is one that divides their time together into 3 parts, so that they can practice hearing from God and obeying and sharing some of the most important things that Jesus commands.

This practice session should last a little over an hour, and it will move quickly. If you have a large group or one that likes deep discussions, you might want to ask one member of the group to help keep you on track with a watch or timer.

In real life, these steps will move at a slower pace, but while you're practicing be sure to keep going so you don't run out of time. Don't skip any steps - they're all important!

Remember a 3/3 Group is not the same as a Bible Study - that's on purpose! Treat this experience as an opportunity to learn a NEW way to meet and see what good God has planned for your time together. Ready to go? Let's get started!

## LOOKING BACK

We'll spend the first third of our time looking back by caring for each other through giving thanks, sharing our struggles and praying for other members of our group. We'll also check in to see if each person in the group has had the opportunity to obey and share what they learned the last time we were together.

**Step One - "Giving Thanks."**

Take some time to have each person share something they are thankful for. Push pause on this video and do that right now… Are you still there? Really, we want you to hit pause, and have each person in your group share something you're thankful to God for. We'll be here when you get back. (2 minutes)

**Step Two - "Sharing your Struggles" and "Praying for One Another."**

Now have each person in your group briefly share something they are struggling with. Have someone else pray for them about what they share. Press pause, then share and pray. (8 minutes)

**Step Three - "Focusing the Group."**

Every time you meet, you'll want to take time and remember why you're together - to love God, to love others, to share Jesus, and help others share Him too. There are lots of ways to focus the group on the mission, but for this practice session have someone read Matthew 22:37-38 out loud to the group. Press pause, then read. (2 minutes)

**Step Four - "Checking In."**

This is the part that some groups want to skip, because it means asking questions that can sometimes be hard. Please don't skip.

Jesus loved His followers enough to ask hard questions. If we want to be like Jesus, we should love one another enough to do that, too. In this step, you'll have each person in the group report on whether they obeyed what they heard.

God ask them to do the last time you were together. In each Zúme session, we've modeled these commitments in our Looking Forward step where we ask you to Obey, Share, and Pray. We model accountability in our Looking Back step where we ask you to Check-In on those same commitments.

If you haven't been spending a lot of time on these steps up to now in the training, this is a good time to start.

Part of loving God is to obey what He tells us. Part of loving one another means helping someone obey what they hear from God. Love means taking someone's commitments seriously - and showing them love graciously - all at the same time.

Press pause and have each person answer the following questions:

- How have you obeyed what you've learned so far?
- Who have you trained in what you've learned?
- Who have you shared your story or God's story with since we've been together as a group?

(12 minutes)

As we finish up the Looking Back section of our 3/3 group, here's something to help your sessions go even better:

**ZÚME COACHING TIP**

Sometimes in a group, one person might be the one who ends up talking most of the time. Don't let this happen. Everyone in the group has value, so make sure everyone gets a chance to share. If others aren't getting a chance to speak, gently remind whoever's talking the most that each person should be heard.

## LOOKING UP

During the middle third of our time together, we invite God's Holy Spirit to lead our group to better understand God's Word. We'll read a passage from the Bible out loud and then ask and answer some simple questions as a group to help explore and understand better God's purposes and plans

**Step One - Invite God's Holy Spirit to Lead**

Take a moment to pray. Talk with God simply and briefly. Ask His Holy Spirit to teach you from the passage you are about to read. Press pause and pray. (2 minutes)

**Step Two - Read God's Word and Ask Questions**

Have someone in the group read from the Bible. For this practice session, read Luke 18:9-14. When you've finished reading, the group should answer these two questions:

- What did you like about this passage?
- What did you find challenging or hard to understand?

If there are oral learners - people who don't read well or prefer to learn by hearing - in your group, make sure you read through the passage at least twice.

Press pause, then read and answer the questions. (10 minutes)

Now have someone else read the same passage a second time, and then have the group answer these two questions:

- What can we learn about people from this passage?
- What can we learn about God from this passage?

Remember stick to the passage and keep it simple! (10 minutes)

That's the end of the Looking Up section of our 3/3 group, and here's something to help your sessions go even better:

**ZÚME COACHING TIP**

When you're studying God's Word, focus on His words instead of other books, teachers, or opinions. Instead of asking, "What do you think this means?" ask "What does this passage say?" If someone in your group likes to teach, gently remind them that God's Holy Spirit and perfect Word can teach the group. We're all here to learn, together. And don't be afraid of silence or a pause in the discussion. God is working even when it's quiet. Stay focused on His Word, stick to the passage, and trust God to do the rest.

## LOOKING FORWARD

In the last third of our time, we'll focus on looking forward to discover how we can obey and train others by what we've learned from God's word. Each member of the group asks God a few simple questions and then waits for His answer in prayer. Then we share and practice our commitments and pray to end our time, together.

**Step 1 - Praying for God's Purpose**

Have each person in your group pray silently and ask God these questions:

- God, how can I obey and apply what You are teaching me?
- Who can I train from this passage so they can learn to obey and love You more?
- Who would you have me share my testimony or Your Good News of Jesus with?

Press pause and then pray. (5 minutes)

Ask God's Holy Spirit to give you specific answers, specific names, and specific steps that you can take in the time between now and when your group meets again.

**Step 2 - Gathering Commitments**

Ask each person in your group to share what they heard from the Lord for each question. Someone may not have heard anything from the Lord on one, two, or even all three questions. They can simply report that they didn't hear.

But remember, the group should hear from the Lord. Jesus said - "My sheep hear My voice." And the more specific your obedience steps are, the easier it will be to obey them before we meet again.

Press pause, and then share what you've heard. (10 minutes)

**Step 3 - Practicing your Plan**

Before you end your time together, have your 3/3 Group break into smaller groups of two or three and practice what you've heard the Lord ask you to do.

Remember - practice isn't obeying, training or sharing, but it does get you ready to do those things better. Have each smaller group end its practice time together in prayer. Pray specifically for those people and plans God has put on your hearts.

If you have oral-learners in the group, set aside part of your practice time to re-read the passage of God's Word you read earlier. This will help the entire group be ready to share with others they meet between meetings.

Press pause, then break into groups to practice and pray. Anyone who doesn't have specific commitments should practice sharing their testimony story or God's Story. (10 minutes)

## COMPLETING OUR TIME TOGETHER

As you bring your group back together, take a moment to celebrate! You've completed the Looking Forward section and have now practiced the entire 3/3 Group format.

Your group will continue to practice without this video guide in later sessions. Be sure to take turns letting others guide the group through the process. You don't have to be a gifted teacher, just follow these simple steps. Before you go, here's one more suggestion to help your sessions go even better:

**ZÚME COACHING TIP**

Around the world, 3/3rds groups often share the Lord's Supper, or a meal and more casual conversations as part of their time together. God gave us this kind of fellowship -- intentional learning and growth and intentional living and relationship to help strengthen, encourage, and build us up to be more like His Son, Jesus.

And that's it - your group has now practiced all three parts -- Looking Back to check in on what we've accomplished since the last time we met, Looking Up to understand what God has for us to learn in this time together, and Looking Forward to put into action what God has put on our hearts while we're apart.

3/3 Groups - a simple and practical way to meet that helps us become more like Jesus.

# (54) Training Cycle Script

**URL:** https://zume.training/en/app/script?s=54

In this session, we'll learn THE TRAINING CYCLE that helps disciples go from one to many and turns a mission into a movement.

Have you ever learned how to ride a bicycle? Have you ever helped someone else learn? If so, chances are you already know THE TRAINING CYCLE.

It's as easy as MODEL, ASSIST, WATCH and LEAVE. Think back - before you ever rode a bicycle, you probably saw someone else ride one first.

That's MODELING.

MODEL, ASSIST, WATCH and LEAVE.

Modeling is simply showing someone else an example of how it's done. When a child first sees someone else riding a bike, they get the idea right away. Modeling is like that -- it doesn't have to be done often, and usually it only needs to be done once.

Think back to that first bike ride. Did you want to just watch? Or were you excited to get on and give it a try? What if nobody ever gave you the chance?

Too much modeling can actually hurt the training process. MODELING is about showing someone just a little - and then giving them a try. So what happened on that first ride? Did they just give you the bicycle and walk away?

Probably not. When most people learn how to ride a bike, someone is right there for the first few pedals. Walking along side and keeping you on track.

That's ASSISTING.

MODEL, ASSIST, WATCH and LEAVE.

Assisting is allowing a learner to practice a skill but making sure the falls aren't too hard. Assisting takes longer than Modeling. But not too long. It requires some hand-holding, some direction and some coaching, but it's just about passing on the basics. It's not about getting someone to perfect. It's about getting them to pedal.

Can you imagine someone running alongside you as you started to pedal fast and gain some speed? They wouldn't last long, and you'd never learn to keep your balance.

ASSISTING is about getting someone going and allowing them to steer a little on their own. And when they start to move, they're actually modeling for the next learner on the way. Even when no one else's hands are on the bike, it doesn't mean you're all alone. Usually there's someone keeping an eye out - but from a distance.

That's WATCHING.

MODEL, ASSIST, WATCH and LEAVE.

Watching is influencing a learner until they're competent in their skill, all without having to step in and take control. In bike riding, someone can get up and going fairly quickly, but that doesn't mean they know all the rules of the road. Watching is about making sure someone's going to be safe - even when no one's around. Watching is about making sure not just that someone knows what to do, but also that they'll do it - even when no one's looking.

In this phase of the Training Cycle, the learner will grow and teach others how to grow... so they teach others how to grow... so they teach others how to grow. Disciples who make disciples who make disciples who make disciples. All the way down to the third and fourth generation.

WATCHING is about making sure a learner matures and is not just willing but also able to help others. Watching takes awhile. It may be ten times as long as Modeling and Assisting, combined. It may be longer. But the wait is always worth it. Eventually -- the rider just rides the bike.

That's what LEAVING is all about.

MODEL, ASSIST, WATCH and LEAVE.

Leaving is like a graduation. A student becomes a teacher. A worker becomes a co-worker. A disciple becomes a friend. In bike riding, the one who teaches you to ride doesn't go along for every ride you take. At times they may ride with you. At times you ride separately, or with others, or alone.

LEAVING is about giving one last gift to someone you love - the gift of freedom. Leaving is about equipping someone to go where you've already gone but also encouraging them to go where you haven't gotten to yet.

MODEL, ASSIST, WATCH and LEAVE. THE TRAINING CYCLE.

From one to many. From a mission to a movement.

# (55) Leadership Cells Script

**URL:** https://zume.training/en/app/script?s=55

In this session, we'll learn how LEADERSHIP CELLS prepare followers in a short time to become leaders for a lifetime.

One becomes two. Two becomes four. Four becomes eight. Individual multiplication. Generational increase. Exponential growth. This is the model God built into His creation. This is the way God intends His family to grow. We've already learned the 3/3rds pattern that turns consumers into producers, learners into leaders and disciples into disciple-makers.

Look Back - Look Up - Look Forward. Learn - Obey - Share.

This way of meeting together produces ongoing spiritual growth in individual believers and ongoing reproductive growth in a group of followers of Jesus. This pattern helps disciples multiply.

But what if a group is together for only a short period of time? Can they still grow and reproduce God's Kingdom? Leadership Cells are a way to put the 3/3rds pattern to work when you know there's a limit to how long a group can be together.

Leadership Cells equip individual believers in a short time to learn reproductive patterns that last a lifetime.

Leadership Cells help learners become leaders who will then start new groups, train new churches, and begin more Leadership Cells to grow God's family.

Leadership Cells work well when a group is mobile. Nomads, students, military personnel, seasonal workers who already follow Jesus work great in a Leadership Cell. Because of their culture, their profession or their season of life - they may have a hard time establishing an ongoing group, but they can absolutely be trained how to start groups in each place they travel.

Leadership Cells also work well when a group of people come to faith at the same time. A family, a network of friends, or even a small village can be trained in a short time to become producers for a lifetime - even without individual follow-ups or spiritual coaching.

In an earlier session, we learned and practiced the last two parts of the 3/3rds pattern. Now will practice the entire pattern -- all three parts -- looking back, looking up, looking forward.

# (56) Non-Sequential Script

In this session, we'll learn how to break the habit of thinking in a linear pattern as a way of accelerating kingdom growth. To make disciples who make disciples more quickly, we have to keep in mind that multiple things can happen at the same time and there is not a certain order in which they need to happen.

We have to learn the power of NON-SEQUENTIAL growth. When people think about disciples multiplying, they often think of it as a step-by-step process.

First prayer. Then preparation. Then sharing God's good news. Then building disciples. Then building churches. Then developing leaders. Then reproduction.

When we learn this way, kingdom growth seems to be an easy-to-follow, linear and sequential process. One problem is that's not how it always works. A bigger problem is that's not how it often works best.

This line represents a person's life. Here's birth. Here's the first time they hear God's good news.

Here's when they choose to follow Jesus. Here's when they first share their story and God's story and they begin to multiply. And here's where this life ends.

So from here to here - from first hearing about Jesus to first sharing about Jesus is what we could consider a spiritual generation.

This amount of time before multiplying. This amount of time before God's family grows. This is how discipleship is usually taught. But when we use a pattern like Greatest Blessing - watch what happens.

Now a new disciple starts multiplying immediately. The spiritual generation shortens. Someone hears God's good news sooner. God's family grows more quickly. More people are saved for eternity.

And all of it - simply by moving when they multiply. But what if we keep going? What if someone starts multiplying even earlier? What if they begin to share after they first hear instead of after they first believe?

Some are open to gathering a group and sharing what they learn from God's Word with friends and family before they ever say "yes" to Jesus. If we show those people how to gather a group and share what they learn and show others how to do the same, God's family grows even faster.

Now discipleship is a path to Jesus not just something we share after salvation. This is a way a family or friends or even a village can come to follow Jesus. But what if someone can multiply even sooner? What if someone could share God's ways before they even meet God's Son?

Sometimes a group may be unable or not ready to hear God's good news immediately. But this group can still learn God's patterns - through efforts like community development or leadership training. This group can begin multiplying God's patterns - learning - obeying - sharing - and teaching others to do the same even before they first hear about Jesus.

When this happens, God's ways are imprinted into willing hearts. His patterns are woven into a community and individual lives. Then when God has prepared His way - God's good news can reveal the truth they've been receiving all along. This is the way an institution, a community, or even a country can come to follow Jesus.

Non-Sequential growth still requires "What's Essential?" thinking. No matter what process - the biggest question is always the same - Who is the good soil that will be faithful? Who will learn and practice and share God's ways?

Uncovering this good soil - discovering these good hearts - is worth all of our time and energy and effort. These are the ones we pour out our hearts to. These are the ones we pour out our lives for. These are the ones who grow God's kingdom best.

# (57) Pace Script

**URL:** https://zume.training/en/app/script?s=57

In this session will learn why multiplying matters and why multiplying quickly matters even more. This session is about PACE. Pace is about time - how quickly or slowly things happen. Pace matters because where we all spend our eternity - an existence that outlasts time - is determined in the short time we call "life".

God's Word tells us that God is patient with us - not wanting anyone to perish, but everyone to turn around and follow Him. God gives us more time because He knows we only have a short time to do all He's called us to do and to reach all He's called us to reach.

To follow Jesus more closely, we have to pursue His people more quickly. We can't just take our time. We have to increase our PACE.

The global church -- all followers of Jesus, together -- is larger than it's ever been. The global church -- all followers of Jesus, together -- is a larger portion of the world's population than ever before. But even with those large numbers - the global church is not growing faster than the global population.

That means that while there are more of us who follow Jesus than ever before, there are even more who are not following Jesus and will spend their eternity separated from Him, more than there have ever been before.

Making disciples who multiply matters. Start with just one disciple. If they multiply and make a new disciple once every 18 months - an entire year and a half - and then those disciples do the same - in 10 years, there will be 64 new followers of Jesus. 64 people will spend their forever with a loving God.

But what if they moved a little faster? What if they increased their PACE?

If they multiply now in 4 months - a quarter of year - instead of 18 months, and those disciple do the same - in 10 years, there will now be a billion new followers of Jesus. Think about that. Instead of less than 100. More than 1,000,000,000.

All by increasing PACE.

Going from 18 months to 4 months means we're moving four-and-a-half times faster. But that acceleration applied to every disciple over the course of 10 years means God's family is growing 15 MILLION TIMES faster. Less than a hundred. More than a billion.

PACE matters.

Sharing our story and God's story and leading someone to follow Jesus grows God's family. Sharing with a new follower how to do exactly the same grows God's family like a wildfire. Exponentially. Like yeast through a loaf.

Like Zúme.

All because of PACE.

# (58) Part of Two Churches Script

**URL:** https://zume.training/en/app/script?s=58

In this session, we'll learn how followers of Jesus can be a PART OF TWO CHURCHES to accelerate growth and help turn a faithful spiritual family into a growing city-wide body of believers. In God's Word - we learn that His perfect plan is for us to live as a spiritual family. The Bible talks about this family as a church in three forms:

- The universal church -- the gathering of all the believers who were, who are and who will be.
- The regional or city church -- the gathering of all the believers in a city or a part of a country.
- The simple church -- the gathering of believers who meet in a small group like in a building or a home.

This smallest group - this elemental church - is the spiritual family that lives life together and it works best when that family can meet and work together for months or years at a time. At the same time, Jesus instructed His followers that they should be continuously starting new spiritual families, growing them to be more like Jesus, and helping them learn how to start new spiritual families, too.

Jesus told us - make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit, teaching them to obey all I have commanded. So how do these two things come together - how can we be a part of a church and be in the process of starting new churches - all at the same time?

Imagine a basic church - just four families. Each pair of symbols represent a different couple who lead their home. All the couples are a part of one church - this is their ongoing spiritual family.

This is who they do life with - the brothers and sisters who encourage them in love and good works. But these same couples are also each working to start a new spiritual family. They're not participating in the same way they do with their own small group family, but they are helping to MODEL and ASSIST as a new spiritual family gets started and grows.

Imagine this - just one church starting four new churches at the exact same time. This is how fast God can grow His family. This is how the church can increase its pace.

In an earlier session, we learned about the TRAINING CYCLE - MODEL, ASSIST, WATCH and LEAVE and we know that these first two phases - MODEL and ASSIST are meant to be moved through quickly - to keep new followers healthy and growing in their faith.

So what happens with the original church and the four churches that they've started? After helping them launch by Modeling and Assisting, these couples (original church) have already helped these new churches (1 gen) begin Modeling and Assisting, as well (for 2 gen). For these four new churches (1 gen), our couples (org. church) are now in the WATCH phase - keeping an eye on the progress of these new churches (1 gen) and coaching as they Model and Assist new churches (2 gen) they help start on their own.

Most people will not be able to Model and Assist for more than one other spiritual family at a time. But they can watch over and coach multiple churches and help them connect with peer mentors as they grow.

That means one single spiritual family - one small group church - can be part of launching many other small group churches at exactly the same time. That's a lot of fruit. So what happens to all these churches as they grow and start new churches that start new churches that start new churches? How do they stay connected? How do they live life as an extended spiritual family?

The answer is that all of these simple churches are just like the cells in a growing body and they connect together and network into a city or regional church. The churches are related. They share the same spiritual DNA. They are all connected out of the same first multiplying family.

And now -- with some guidance - they come together as a larger body to do even more.

# (60) Coaching Checklist Script

**URL:** https://zume.training/en/app/script?s=60

Jesus said - "Greater love has no one than this - to lay down one's life for one's friends." Jesus told us then showed us again and again that God's family grows best when we are willing to give up our wants for God's will.

The Coaching Checklist is a simple tool you can use to help guide you as you assist others through various parts of Zume Training like The Training Cycle or their List of 100.

What skills are you seeing develop in others? What areas still need to be developed?

Having a Coaching Checklist will help you stay focused and engaged as you develop followers of Jesus into leaders in God's family, everywhere you go.

Yes, it takes time and effort. Yes, it means sacrifices and giving up our preferences for God's perfect plan. And yes, more than all of that, it's worth it.

The Coaching Checklist a simple tool from the Zume Toolkit to help keep you in life's greatest game -- God's Work.

# (61) Leadership in Networks Script

**URL:** https://zume.training/en/app/script?s=61

In this session, we'll learn how LEADERSHIP IN NETWORKS allows a growing group of small churches to work together, grow new leaders and accomplish even more of the good things God has planned for His people.

So what happens to churches as they grow and start new churches that start new churches that start new churches? How do they stay connected? How do they live life together as an extended spiritual family?

The answer is that all of these simple churches are just like the cells in a growing body and they connect and network into a city or regional church.

The churches are related. They share the same spiritual DNA. They are all connected out of the same first multiplying family. And now -- with some guidance - they come together as a larger body to do even more. At the city and regional level, God's Word shows that the growing body of believers is served by a new group of leaders.

In the New Testament, the church calls these servants Elders and Deacons, Shepherds and Overseers of the flock. We learn in God's Word that the multitude of small home churches in the city of Jerusalem, were served by a group of 7 servants - or deacons.

We learn in God's Word that the multitude of home churches in the city of Ephesus were served by a small group of Elders - shepherds who were to follow the model of the Good Shepherd Jesus and lay down their lives for their flock.

In the city or region, we also see a group of five leadership gifts given. God's Word says -- Christ Himself gave the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, the pastors and teachers, to equip his people for works of service, so that the body of Christ may be built up.

These spiritual gifts are given not so a small group can do all the work of the church but so they could serve and prepare the followers of Jesus to do the work - so the whole body of believers could work together to accomplish all God has in His heart to do.

In addition to or in place of meeting with their own spiritual family, these leaders meet and pray and fellowship and encourage one another in much the same way that any simple church in a home would.

The 3/3rds pattern is used in leadership training meetings and peer mentoring.

The Four Fields pattern is used for planning, evaluation and coaching at higher levels just as it is at the local level.

When the leaders meet they share what is happening not only as individuals but also across their network. They represent the families and share about the well-being of the ones they serve. A good place for a network of spiritual families to center is the place where that network starts. A church network that launches from Tampa will start as a city church in Tampa. As they grow and serve throughout the state, they will act on behalf of the network in Florida. As they send and serve around the country and around the world, they begin to function at a national or even international level.

Jesus said - If you're faithful in little things, you will be faithful in large ones.

These networks of churches remain connected because of their common spiritual DNA and shared beginnings. Sometimes the networks split off into multiple networks based on language, opportunities to meet or other reasons.

This is part of growth and not a problem. The willingness of simple churches and individual followers to learn, obey and share God's Word is the spiritual DNA of a movement. If it is passed on successfully from generation to generation, from church to church and from believer to believer then everything needed to begin a new movement of multiplying disciples is already present in every spiritual family and in every follower of Jesus.

When movements launch movements, that's when... we start to see the "leaven" working through the dough of a city or a state or even a nation. That is how the Kingdom of God comes in such a way that God's will is being done on earth as it is in heaven. That is how we can finish the Great Commission by making disciples of all nations.

# (63) 3-Circles Script

**Source:** https://zume.training/en/app/script?s=63

Welcome back to Zume Training. 

In this session, we'll learn how to share God's story, the Gospel, by using a tool called Three Circles. 

There are many ways to share God's story. The best way will depend on the person you're sharing with, and their view of the world and their life experiences. 

God uses hearts willing to share to work on hearts willing to hear. 

It's His work; He just invites us to join in.

One way to share God's story is by sharing a simple drawing that we call Three Circles. 

All of us live in a very broken world. We see and hear stories of suffering, death, war, disease, addictions. It's everywhere. But this is not God's original design. 

God's perfect design is a world full of love, joy, unity, and peace.

The way we took ourselves out of God's perfect design and came into brokenness is through something the Bible calls sin. 

Sin is turning away from God's way and pursuing our own way. Sin separates us from God. Sin throws us into brokenness. Sin leads us to spiritual death.

People want out of brokenness. We try all kinds of different things to get out. 

Some of us try drugs and alcohol. Some of us try to get out through a good job or by making a lot of money. Some of us think a relationship will get them out. Some even try religion. We think good behavior or helping others will set us free. 

None of these things ever actually fix the problem of brokenness. 

Even when we feel like we get away for a moment, we're snapped right back to where we started.

Here's a difficult truth: If we're still there, still in brokenness when this life ends, then the Bible says we're permanently separated from God, forever. 

The Bible calls that place Hell. 

But God doesn't want us to stay in brokenness. The Bible says God loved us so much that He sent His own Son to make a way out for us.

Jesus came to Earth to erase our sin and take us away from brokenness. 

But how? How could Jesus do all this? 

Jesus lived a perfect life. Jesus was the only person who never sinned. Jesus was the only person who stayed in God's perfect design. Then Jesus gave up His perfect life and took our place. 

He died on a cross to pay the price for our sin. 

So Jesus, God's Son, canceled our sin with His death. 

Three days after Jesus died and was buried, He rose from the dead.

Because of His great sacrifice, God made Jesus the king of everything in Heaven and everything on Earth. 

King Jesus made a way out of brokenness for us. God said that if we turn from our sin and believe that Jesus died for us, and are baptized in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, then God raises us, just like Jesus, to walk in a new kind of life as part of God's family forever.

We then model this new life in the broken world, and await Jesus' return when He will make a new Heaven and new Earth where we can be with Him forever in perfect wholeness. 

God wants us to grow in our relationship with Him. God wants us restored back into His original perfect design.

As part of God's family, Jesus gives us a mission, a reason for living, and a way to live the best possible life. 
Jesus' mission for us is to go. Jesus sends us, just like His Father, God, sent Him, back into brokenness to help others break free and become part of God's forever family too.

In this Three Circles world, there are only two kinds of people: people who are a part of God's perfect design, living out God's rescue mission, helping reconnect God to His forever family, or people who are still in brokenness, trying everything to break free, hoping that someone will save them. 

Do you know where you are now? Do you know where you want to be?

There are many ways to share God's story. The important thing is to share. 

God uses hearts willing to share to work on hearts willing to hear. 

It's His work; He just invites us to join in.

# (68) 4-Relationships Script

**Source:** https://zume.training/en/app/script?s=68

God is relational. Even within Himself. He has always existed in three persons: God the Father, God the Son and God the Holy Spirit. This triune God exists in perfect harmony. He chose to create all things and pursued a relationship with His creation.

When God created the world, he placed mankind as the caretaker over all the earth. He had an intimate relationship with the first couple. All was well between God and man, and all was well within mankind. All was well with creation, and all was well within themselves, having no pride or fear. They demonstrated their love for God through obedience to Him, living out his purpose by caring for creation. Then, in pride and selfishness, they chose to disobey God and pursued their own way. This broke their relationship with God. They became like a ship without an anchor, adrift on the sea. Brokenness replaced their right relationship with God, with mankind, with creation and even within themselves. Pride and fear distorted their thinking. Death, disease and decay entered the world.

Since then, mankind has sought to restore all of those relationships to their original perfection. He has developed religious and philosophical systems in order to rectify his relationship with God. He has developed systems of government and organization to fix all the relationships with mankind. He has developed technologies to manage his environment in order to control creation. He has pursued all sorts of ways to be happy and peaceful and content within himself. 

The problem is all these attempts have been unsuccessful. At best, these solutions have been imperfect or temporary. As finite beings, no human effort can establish a right relationship with an infinite God. Wars, divisions and resentment still characterize human relationships. Mankind's relationship with creation has resulted in many advances, but often at the cost of damage to the environment. Pride and fear continue to lead to selfishness, self delusion, inner turmoil and dissatisfaction with life.

Only God can restore these broken relationships. And he did so by sending God the Son to earth as a human. His name was Jesus. Born of a virgin, he was both human and divine. He lived in Israel in the first century. In fact, history is divided into B.C. (Before Christ), and A.D. (Anno Domini) or "year of the Lord" because of his birth.

During his time on earth, Jesus perfectly obeyed God the Father. He also perfectly followed the leadership of God the Holy Spirit. His perfect obedience makes him the first and the only person to have an unbroken relationship with God. Death entered creation as a result of the broken relationship with God and had been an unalterable feature of existence until Jesus. Because of his perfect relationship with God, Jesus did not deserve death, but he willingly subjected himself to death on behalf of all mankind. Jesus took mankind's disobedience and imperfection and he offered them His obedience and perfection in life. 

God the Father demonstrated his acceptance of Jesus' sacrifice by raising him from the dead after three days. After his resurrection, Jesus remained on earth in a perfect and glorified body for forty days before ascending to heaven. He told his followers that anyone who believed this Good News and received this gift by faith would be given the right to become a child of God.

These believers would then submit to God and show others the inward change that was taking place with the outward action of baptism. Their body would be completely submerged underwater to show that they were dying to their old and broken way of life. They would then be pulled up out of the water to show that they had been born again to a new life in God. These believers would now live a new life of faith, obeying all that Jesus taught and commanded, while teaching others to do the same. He promised that once they received this gift of new life, they would be given "God the Holy Spirit" to live within them and guide them and enable them to obey God.

After receiving these gifts, people can begin the journey towards the full restoration of the original perfection that God intended. Jesus promised that one day he would return again to the earth. This time not as a helpless child, but as a ruling King. He will judge the earth at that time. All who have loved and followed him, both the living and the dead, will be given new, perfect, eternal bodies. All of creation will be remade in perfection without decay or death. There will be no more tears or pain. All relationships with God, man, creation and self will finally be made perfect.

Unfortunately, those who have not chosen to love and follow God will be separated forever from Him in a place of even greater brokenness and destruction, reaping the full affects of their choice to pursue their own way. This will result in eternal suffering.

Where would you say you are on your spiritual journey? Are you still living in brokenness and trying to figure out solutions on your own? Have you believed in Jesus' sacrifice which enables people to be part of God's family? Have you joined God's family by submitting your life completely to Him in faith and obedience? Have you publicly shown this by being baptized after making this commitment? Do you share this Good News with others so that they may also believe and follow Him? Do you equip those who believe to grow in their spiritual lives and equip them to help others grow in the same ways? 

If you are already part of God's family, go to Zume.Training to learn how to make your next steps on your spiritual journey.
