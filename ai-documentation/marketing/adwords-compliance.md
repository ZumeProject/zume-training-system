# Guide to Writing Compliant Ads for Christian Discipleship Training

The most important principle to understand from Google's policy is the distinction between ad content and ad targeting. Your ads can contain religious terms, but they cannot be used to target users based on their religious identity. The following guide is designed to help you create ad copy that focuses on user needs and search intent rather than a user's personal identity, thereby aligning with Google's policies.

DO: Focus on User Intent, Needs, and Program Benefits

The goal is to frame your discipleship program as a solution to a user's search for personal growth, community, or leadership skills. This approach appeals to a user's interests rather than their perceived religious identity.

- Focus on Action and Growth: Use verbs that describe what the user will learn or achieve.
- Highlight Universal Values: Emphasize benefits like leadership, community service, and personal development.
- Describe the Program's Content: You are permitted to use terms like "Christian," "biblical," and "faith-based" to describe your program, as long as the targeting is compliant.
- Target Broad, Interest-Based Audiences: When setting up your campaigns, target users interested in topics like "community service" or "charitable activities" rather than trying to target users by religion.

Compliant Headline Examples

- Develop Your Leadership Skills: This focuses on a non-sensitive user need (skill development) which is a compliant advertising strategy.
- Faith-Based Community Leadership: The use of "Faith-Based" is permissible in the ad's content. The headline describes the program's topic, not the user's identity.
- Biblical Studies & Mentorship: This headline describes the service offered ("religious guidance," "religious education") without targeting users based on that identity.
- Find Purpose in Community Service: This appeals to a user's interest in "volunteering events" or "community service," which are compliant targeting criteria.
- A Journey of Personal Growth: The language is centered on a universal user need, which aligns with Google's principle of focusing on user interest, not identity.

Compliant Description Examples

- Our discipleship program builds strong leaders for community outreach. Learn practical skills based on biblical principles. This describes the program's content and its benefits without making assumptions about the user's beliefs. It connects to the compliant interest of "community service".
- Seeking personal development? Our courses offer guidance on faith, purpose, and leading a fulfilling life. All are welcome. This description focuses on a user's search for "guidance" and "personal development," which is a compliant intent-based approach.
- Explore faith-based teachings in a supportive community. We offer mentorship and training for local service projects. This uses the acceptable term "faith-based" and highlights the compliant activity of "community service".

DON'T: Focus on the User's Religious Identity

The core violation of this policy is targeting users based on their "fundamental or intrinsic self-identity or their belief systems". Your ad copy should never assume, single out, or call out a user's religious affiliation.

- Directly Address a Religious Group: Avoid headlines like "For Christians in Colorado" or "Calling All Believers".
- Assume the User's Identity: Do not use phrases like "Is your faith important to you?" or "As a Christian, you know...".
- Promote Exclusivity Based on Religion: Avoid language that suggests the program is only for people of a specific faith.
- Build Targeting Lists from Religious Affiliation: Never use an advertiser-curated audience list of email addresses from a church directory or a remarketing list of visitors to religious education pages on your site.

Non-Compliant Headline Examples

- Discipleship for Devout Christians: This explicitly targets users based on their "Personal religious beliefs," which is a direct violation of the personalized advertising policy.
- Are You a Christian Leader?: This headline attempts to single out users based on their religious identity, which is prohibited.
- Training for Your Church Members: This implies targeting based on affiliation with "places of worship" and suggests the use of a prohibited advertiser-curated audience list.
- Find Christian Fellowship Here: This could be interpreted by automated systems as targeting users based on their religious identity or belief system.
- Colorado's Best Christian Training: While it may seem like a location-based ad, combining it with "Christian" can be interpreted by automated systems as an attempt to target a specific religious identity within a geographic area.

Non-Compliant Description Examples

- Join other Christians in our exclusive discipleship program. This course is designed for believers looking to deepen their faith. This description explicitly targets users based on their religious belief system, which is not allowed in personalized advertising.
- If you're a Christian, you'll love our training program. We help followers of Christ become strong leaders. The copy makes a direct assumption about the user's identity ("If you're a Christian"), a clear violation of the policy against targeting based on belief systems.
- We've trained thousands of churchgoers. Our list of members from local churches can attest to our success. This description is an egregious violation, as it implies the use of advertiser-curated lists (e.g., church directories), which are subject to the strictest rules.
