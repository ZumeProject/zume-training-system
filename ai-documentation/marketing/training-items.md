# Detailed Descriptions

A comprehensive guide to all 33 topics in the Zume training curriculum, with detailed explanations of each concept and tool for disciple-making and church multiplication.

## Complete Topic Descriptions

### 1. God Uses Ordinary People
God intentionally chooses ordinary, everyday people to accomplish His extraordinary purposes in the world. This foundational truth liberates believers from feeling inadequate or unqualified for ministry work. The training emphasizes that God's power is made perfect in human weakness, and that simple obedience to God's leading is more valuable than impressive credentials or natural abilities.

### 2. Simple Definition of Disciple and Church
A disciple is someone who hears God's voice and obeys it, while a church is simply two or more believers gathered in Jesus' name. This simplified understanding removes the complexity and institutional barriers that often prevent people from engaging in disciple-making. The training challenges traditional notions of what constitutes "real" ministry and encourages believers to start where they are with what they have.

### 3. Spiritual Breathing is Hearing and Obeying God
Spiritual breathing represents the continuous cycle of receiving from God (hearing) and responding to Him (obeying). This metaphor helps believers understand that spiritual life requires ongoing communication with God, not just occasional religious activities. The practice involves daily listening for God's voice through Scripture, prayer, and circumstances, then immediately acting on what He reveals.

### 4. S.O.A.P.S. Bible Study
S.O.A.P.S. is a simple, reproducible Bible study method that anyone can use daily: Scripture (read a passage), Observation (what you notice), Application (how it applies to your life), Prayer (talk to God about it), and Sharing (tell someone else what you learned). This method transforms Bible reading from passive consumption to active engagement and creates natural opportunities for discipleship conversations.

### 5. Accountability Groups
Accountability groups are weekly gatherings of 2-4 believers who encourage one another, share struggles, and hold each other responsible for spiritual growth goals. These groups provide the relational support and gentle correction needed for sustained spiritual development. The training teaches how to form these groups, what questions to ask, and how to create a safe environment for vulnerability and growth.

### 6. Consumer vs Producer Lifestyle
This topic contrasts four different ways God transforms followers: from consumer to producer, from producer to consumer, from consumer to consumer, and from producer to producer. The training helps believers identify their current spiritual posture and move toward becoming producers who multiply disciples rather than just consuming religious content. It emphasizes that spiritual maturity is measured by fruitfulness, not just knowledge.

### 7. How to Spend an Hour in Prayer
This practical guide breaks down how to structure an extended prayer time using the Lord's Prayer as a framework. The training teaches participants to divide their hour into specific segments for adoration, confession, thanksgiving, and supplication. It includes practical tips for maintaining focus and creating a sustainable prayer rhythm that can transform one's spiritual life.

### 8. Relational Stewardship – List of 100
The List of 100 is a strategic tool for managing relationships by identifying 100 people in your life who need Jesus or spiritual growth. This tool helps believers be intentional about their relational investments and provides a framework for prayer and evangelism. The training teaches how to categorize relationships, pray strategically, and look for opportunities to share the gospel or disciple others.

### 9. Spiritual Economy
Spiritual economy explains how God invests in people and expects a return on His investment through multiplication. This concept helps believers understand that God has given them spiritual gifts, resources, and opportunities that He expects them to steward well. The training emphasizes that spiritual wealth increases through giving away what God has given, not hoarding it for personal benefit.

### 10. The Gospel and How to Share It
This comprehensive overview covers the gospel story from creation to the end times, providing believers with a complete narrative to share with others. The training teaches how to present the gospel in a way that connects with people's felt needs and life experiences. It includes practical tips for starting spiritual conversations and responding to common questions about faith.

### 11. Baptism and How To Do It
This practical training covers the biblical meaning of baptism, when someone is ready for baptism, and how to perform a baptism ceremony. It emphasizes that baptism is a public declaration of faith and the beginning of a disciple's journey, not the end goal. The training includes step-by-step instructions for planning and conducting baptism services in various settings.

### 12. Prepare Your 3-Minute Testimony
A 3-minute testimony is a concise, compelling story of how God has worked in your life that can be shared in any conversation. This training teaches believers how to craft their personal story with a clear beginning, middle, and end that points to Jesus. It includes practice exercises and tips for adapting the testimony to different audiences and situations.

### 13. Vision Casting the Greatest Blessing
The greatest blessing is having spiritual children and grandchildren through disciple-making, which brings more joy than any earthly achievement. This topic helps believers understand that their legacy will be measured by the people they've helped follow Jesus, not by their personal accomplishments. The training teaches how to communicate this vision to others and inspire them to join in the disciple-making mission.

### 14. Duckling Discipleship – Leading Immediately
Duckling discipleship encourages new believers to begin leading others immediately, even while they're still learning themselves. This approach recognizes that leadership is learned through practice, not just study, and that God can use even immature believers to help others grow. The training provides practical ways for new disciples to start serving and leading from day one.

### 15. Eyes to See Where the Kingdom Isn't
This topic develops spiritual awareness to recognize where God's kingdom is not yet present or active in the world around us. It teaches believers to look for spiritual needs, broken relationships, and areas of darkness that need God's light. The training helps participants develop a missional mindset that sees every situation as a potential opportunity for kingdom impact.

### 16. The Lord's Supper and How To Lead It
This practical training covers the biblical meaning of communion, when and how often to celebrate it, and how to lead a meaningful Lord's Supper service. It emphasizes that communion is a celebration of Jesus' sacrifice and a reminder of our unity as believers. The training includes sample prayers, readings, and practical considerations for celebrating communion in various settings.

### 17. Prayer Walking and How To Do It
Prayer walking involves praying while walking through neighborhoods, workplaces, or other areas where you want to see God's kingdom come. This practice combines physical activity with spiritual intercession, helping believers connect with their communities on a deeper level. The training teaches how to organize prayer walks, what to pray for, and how to recognize and respond to divine appointments.

### 18. A Person of Peace and How To Find One
A person of peace is someone who is open to the gospel and can help introduce you to their network of relationships. This topic teaches how to identify these key people who can open doors for evangelism and discipleship. The training includes practical strategies for finding people of peace and building relationships with them that lead to spiritual conversations.

### 19. Faithfulness is Better Than Knowledge
This principle emphasizes that consistent obedience to what we already know is more valuable than accumulating more biblical knowledge without application. The training challenges believers to focus on implementing what they've learned rather than constantly seeking new information. It includes practical ways to measure faithfulness and develop habits of consistent spiritual practice.

### 20. The BLESS Prayer Pattern
BLESS is a prayer mnemonic that helps believers pray for their neighbors and coworkers: Body (physical needs), Labor (work and career), Emotional (emotional and mental health), Social (relationships), and Spiritual (spiritual needs). This tool provides a structured way to pray comprehensively for people and often reveals opportunities to serve and share the gospel. The training teaches how to use this pattern effectively and integrate it into daily prayer routines.

### 21. 3/3 Group Meeting Pattern
The 3/3 pattern is a simple, reproducible structure for small group meetings that can be led by anyone: first third (looking back at last week), second third (looking up to God through Bible study), and third third (looking ahead to next week). This format ensures groups stay focused on spiritual growth and accountability while remaining simple enough for new leaders to implement. The training provides detailed guidance for each section and tips for facilitating effective discussions.

### 22. Training Cycle for Maturing Disciples
This training cycle provides a systematic approach to developing mature disciples through four phases: I do, you watch; I do, you help; You do, I help; You do, I watch. This method ensures that discipleship is both caught and taught, with practical experience building alongside theoretical knowledge. The training includes specific activities and milestones for each phase of development.

### 23. Leadership Cells
Leadership cells are small groups focused specifically on developing leadership skills and character in emerging leaders. These groups provide intensive training in areas like vision casting, team building, and problem solving while maintaining accountability and support. The training teaches how to identify potential leaders, structure leadership development content, and create opportunities for practical leadership experience.

### 24. Expect Non-Sequential Growth
Non-sequential growth recognizes that spiritual development doesn't always follow a predictable, linear pattern. This topic helps leaders understand that setbacks, plateaus, and unexpected breakthroughs are normal parts of the discipleship journey. The training provides strategies for supporting people through various growth phases and maintaining momentum even when progress seems slow.

### 25. Pace of Multiplication Matters
The speed at which disciples and churches multiply significantly impacts the overall growth of God's kingdom. This topic emphasizes that while quality is important, the pace of multiplication should be intentionally accelerated through systematic disciple-making processes. The training teaches how to balance rapid multiplication with healthy development and avoid common obstacles that slow down growth.

### 26. Always Part of Two Churches
This strategy encourages believers to be part of two churches: one where they receive spiritual care and one where they serve and minister to others. This approach ensures that everyone is both being discipled and making disciples, creating a sustainable multiplication cycle. The training provides practical guidance for balancing involvement in both churches and managing the time commitments effectively.

### 27. Three-Month Plan
A three-month plan provides a structured approach to implementing disciple-making strategies with specific goals, timelines, and accountability measures. This planning tool helps believers move from good intentions to concrete action steps that lead to measurable results. The training teaches how to create realistic plans, track progress, and adjust strategies based on outcomes and feedback.

### 28. Coaching Checklist
The coaching checklist is a self-assessment tool that helps leaders evaluate their effectiveness in key areas of disciple-making and church multiplication. This tool provides objective criteria for measuring progress and identifying areas that need improvement or additional training. The training includes how to use the checklist effectively and develop action plans based on assessment results.

### 29. Leadership in Networks
This topic explores how to develop and maintain connections between churches and leaders in a network that supports multiplication and resource sharing. It emphasizes that isolated churches and leaders are less effective than those connected in supportive relationships. The training teaches practical strategies for building networks, facilitating collaboration, and creating systems for ongoing support and accountability.

### 30. Peer Mentoring Groups
Peer mentoring groups bring together leaders at similar stages of development to learn from each other, share challenges, and provide mutual support. These groups create a collaborative learning environment where leaders can grow together rather than in isolation. The training covers how to form effective peer groups, facilitate meaningful discussions, and ensure that all participants benefit from the shared experience.

### 31. Four Fields Tool
The Four Fields tool helps believers assess kingdom activity in their area by examining four key areas: the harvest field (people ready to receive the gospel), the seed sowers (believers sharing the gospel), the soil (hearts and minds of people), and the seasons (timing and circumstances). This assessment tool provides a comprehensive view of evangelism opportunities and helps prioritize ministry efforts. The training teaches how to conduct four fields assessments and develop strategies based on the findings.

### 32. Generational Mapping
Generational mapping is a visual tool that tracks how disciples and churches multiply over time, showing the growth pattern and identifying where multiplication is happening or needs to happen. This tool helps leaders see the big picture of their disciple-making efforts and identify areas that need attention or resources. The training includes how to create and maintain generational maps, interpret the data, and use insights to improve multiplication strategies.

### 33. 3-Circles Gospel Presentation
The 3-Circles gospel presentation uses three overlapping circles to illustrate God's design, brokenness in the world, and the gospel as the solution. This simple visual tool makes the gospel easy to understand and share in any conversation or setting. The training teaches how to draw the circles, explain each section, and transition naturally into gospel conversations with people from various backgrounds and beliefs.

## Summary

These 33 topics provide a comprehensive foundation for disciple-making and church multiplication, combining essential concepts with practical tools that can be immediately implemented. The training emphasizes simplicity, reproducibility, and immediate application, ensuring that participants can start making disciples right away rather than waiting until they feel fully prepared. Each topic builds on the others to create a complete system for spiritual multiplication that can be adapted to various cultural and ministry contexts.
