## Coaching Methodologies and Tools

### Biblical Foundation

All coaching is grounded in foundational disciple-making principles that come straight from the Bible and have been tested globally for over thirty years. Coaches help participants understand not just what to do, but why these approaches align with biblical patterns of multiplication.

### Practical Skills Development

Coaching focuses on 22 core competencies covered in Zúme Training:
- **Relational Skills**: Prayer, S.O.A.P.S. Bible study, accountability relationships
- **Evangelistic Skills**: Sharing personal testimony, gospel presentation, spiritual conversation
- **Multiplication Skills**: Training others, church planting, leadership development
- **Movement Skills**: Vision casting, network building, obstacle navigation

### Contextual Adaptation

Coaches use peer mentoring group formats that follow Jesus' example of ministry from scripture, asking questions and giving feedback. This approach ensures that universal biblical principles are applied in culturally appropriate and contextually relevant ways.

### Assessment and Progress Tracking

Coaching includes systematic competency assessment to ensure real skill development rather than just knowledge acquisition. Progress is measured by actual disciple-making fruit: conversations initiated, relationships developed, disciples trained, groups started, and leaders raised up.

## Investment and Accessibility

### Completely Free Service

Free access to all training materials and online coaching removes financial barriers that might prevent participation. This aligns with Zúme's mission to make disciple-making training accessible to ordinary believers worldwide, regardless of economic circumstances.

### No Organizational Requirements

Since Zúme is not run by an organization, there is no formal statement of faith requirement beyond basic agreement with evangelical principles as outlined in the Lausanne Covenant. This creates accessibility across denominational and organizational boundaries.

### Volunteer Commitment Model

The volunteer coach model ensures sustainability and authenticity while maintaining accessibility. Coaches participate because of personal conviction and kingdom passion rather than financial motivation, creating genuine mentoring relationships focused on multiplication impact.



### Long-Term Vision

The vision is comparable to yeast working through entire dough, spreading basic Kingdom tools into neighborhoods worldwide. Through coaching relationships, Zúme aims to create a global network of competent disciple-makers who can sustain and expand multiplication movements in every cultural context.

**Ultimate Goal**: To train at least one disciple maker for every 5,000 people in North America and one disciple maker for every 50,000 people globally, with trained disciple makers starting at least 2 simple multiplying churches for every 5,000 people.
