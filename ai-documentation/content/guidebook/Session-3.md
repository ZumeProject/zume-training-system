### Spiritual Economy

In this session, we’ll talk about God’s **SPIRITUAL ECONOMY**. In this broken world, people feel rewarded when they take, when they receive and when they gain more than those around them.

In His Scriptures, God tells His people – *My thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways My ways.*  
God shows us in His Kingdom economy we’re rewarded not by what we get – but by what we give away.  
God says – *I will save you, and you will be a blessing.* Jesus said – *It is better to give than to receive.*  

Giving away what God gives us and blessing others when God blesses us is the foundation for **the SPIRITUAL BREATHING** we learned about before. We breathe IN and HEAR from God.  
We breathe OUT and OBEY what we hear and SHARE with others.

When we are faithful to **OBEY** and **SHARE** what the Lord has shared with us, then He promises to share even more.  
Jesus said – *Whoever can be trusted with very little can also be trusted with much.*

This is the path to deeper insights, greater intimacy and living the abundant life God created us to live. This is the way we can walk in the good works God has already planned for us to do.

If we want to be rewarded with God’s greatest reward, then we have to practice the two things that He promises to bless.  
We must –  

- **OBEY** and **SHARE**  
- **DO** and **TEACH**  
- **PRACTICE** and **PASS ON**

Jesus said, “You will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you. And you will be my witnesses, telling people about me everywhere – in Jerusalem, throughout Judea, in Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.” – everything that God tells us to do.

If we want others to receive God’s greatest reward, then we have to show them how to do the same thing, too. This is a major part of being a disciple and a major part of making disciples.

We are **FOLLOWERS** and **LEADERS**  
We are **LEARNERS** and **TEACHERS**  
We are **BLESSED** and we are a **BLESSING**

God doesn’t want us to wait until we know everything before we start obeying and sharing. That day will never come.  
God doesn’t expect us to be fully mature before we start multiplying. He wants us to multiply right away.

God wants us to obey what we already know and to share what we’ve already heard.  
And then He wants us to teach others to do the same. After all – that’s obeying and sharing what He’s already told us to do.  
This is the path to maturity and growth.

## DISCUSS (10 min)

- What are some differences you see between God’s Spiritual Economy and our earthly way of getting things done?

---

## DISCUSS (10 min)

- What comes to mind when you hear God’s command to be His “witness” and to tell His story?  
- Why do you think Jesus chose ordinary people instead of some other way to share His good news?  
- What would it take for you to feel more comfortable sharing God’s story?

---

## The Gospel

There’s no one “best way” to tell God’s story (also called the gospel), because the best way will depend on who you’re sharing with. The best way will depend on who you’re sharing with and their view of the world and their life experiences.

Every disciple should learn to tell God’s story in a way that’s true to scripture and connects with the audience they’re sharing with.

Review the following two presentations and choose one to practice.

### Presentation 1

In this session, we’ll learn how to share GOD’S STORY – The Gospel – from Creation to Judgement, from the beginning of humankind to the end of this age. There are many ways to share God’s story.

The best way will depend on the person you’re sharing with and their view of the world and their life experiences.  
God uses hearts willing to share to work on hearts willing to hear.  
It’s His work. He just invites us to join in.

One way to share God’s Story is by explaining what’s happened from God’s Creation to His Judgement at the end of this age. When we tell God’s story in this way, we can make it long or short, detailed or just broad strokes but always connected to the culture of the one who hears. To help tell His Story across different cultures and world views, you can also use hand motions that make it easier to learn and teach.

**Here is God’s Story of Good News**

- In the beginning, God made the whole world and everything in it.  
  He created the FIRST MAN and the FIRST WOMAN. He placed them in a beautiful garden.  
  He made them PART OF HIS FAMILY and had a CLOSE RELATIONSHIP with them.  
  He created them to LIVE FOREVER. There was no such thing as death.  
  Even in this perfect place, man rebelled against God and brought SIN and SUFFERING into the world.  
  God BANISHED man from the garden. The relationship between man and God was BROKEN. Now man would have to face DEATH.

- Over many hundreds of years, God kept sending MESSENGERS into the world. They reminded man of his sin but also told him of God’s FAITHFULNESS and PROMISE to send a SAVIOR into the world.

- The Savior would RESTORE the close relationship between God and Man.  
  The Savior would RESCUE man from death.  
  The Savior would give ETERNAL LIFE and be with man forever.

- God loves us so much that when the time was right, He sent His Son into the world to be that SAVIOR.  
  Jesus was God’s Son. He was born into the world through a virgin.  
  He lived a perfect life. He never sinned. Jesus taught people about God.  
  He performed many miracles showing His great power.  
  He cast out many demons. He healed many people. He made the blind see.  
  He made the deaf hear. He made the lame walk. Jesus even raised the dead.

- Many religious leaders were THREATENED and JEALOUS of Jesus. They wanted Him killed.

- Since He never sinned, Jesus did not have to die. But He CHOSE to die as a SACRIFICE for all of us.  
  His painful death covered up the sins of mankind.

- After this, Jesus was buried in a tomb. God saw the SACRIFICE Jesus made and accepted it.  
  God showed His acceptance by raising Jesus from the dead on the third day.

- God said that if we BELIEVE and RECEIVE Jesus’ sacrifice for our sins – If we TURN AWAY from our sins and FOLLOW Jesus, God CLEANS US from all sin and WELCOMES us back into His family.

- God sends the HOLY SPIRIT to live inside us and make us able to follow Jesus.  
  We are BAPTIZED in water to show and seal this restored relationship. As a symbol of death we are buried beneath the water. As a symbol of new life we are raised out of the water to follow Jesus.

- When Jesus rose from the dead, He spent 40 days on earth.  
  Jesus taught His followers to go everywhere and tell the good news of His salvation to everyone around the world.  
  Jesus said – Go and MAKE DISCIPLES of all nations, BAPTIZING them in the name of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit; and TEACHING them to obey all I have commanded. I will be with you always – even to the end of this age.

- Jesus was then TAKEN UP before their eyes into heaven. One day, Jesus will COME AGAIN in the same way He left.  
  He will PUNISH FOREVER those who did not love and obey Him.  
  He will RECEIVE and REWARD FOREVER those who did love and obey Him.  
  We will LIVE FOREVER with Him in a New Heaven and on a New Earth.

- I BELIEVED and RECEIVED the sacrifice Jesus made for my sins. He has made me clean and restored me as part of God’s family.  
  He loves me, and I love Him and will live with Him forever in His kingdom.

- God loves you and wants you to receive this gift, as well. Would you like to do that right now?

### Presentation 2

Welcome back to Zume Training.

In this session, we’ll learn how to share God’s story, the Gospel, by using a tool called Three Circles.

There are many ways to share God’s story. The best way will depend on the person you’re sharing with, and their view of the world and their life experiences.

God uses hearts willing to share to work on hearts willing to hear.  
It’s His work; He just invites us to join in.

One way to share God’s story is by sharing a simple drawing that we call Three Circles.

All of us live in a very broken world. We see and hear stories of suffering, death, war, disease, addictions. It’s everywhere. But this is not God’s original design. God’s perfect design is a world full of love, joy, unity, and peace.

The way we took ourselves out of God’s perfect design and came into brokenness is through something the Bible calls sin.  
Sin is turning away from God’s way and pursuing our own way. Sin separates us from God.  
Sin throws us into brokenness. Sin leads us to spiritual death.

People want out of brokenness. We try all kinds of different things to get out.  
Some of us try drugs and alcohol. Some of us try to get out through a good job or by making a lot of money.  
Some of us think a relationship will get them out. Some even try religion. We think good behavior or helping others will set us free.

None of these things ever actually fix the problem of brokenness.  
Even when we feel like we get away for a moment, we’re snapped right back to where we started.

Here’s a difficult truth: If we’re still there, still in brokenness when this life ends, then the Bible says we’re permanently separated from God, forever.  
The Bible calls that place Hell.

But God doesn’t want us to stay in brokenness. The Bible says God loved us so much that He sent His own Son to make a way out for us.

Jesus came to Earth to erase our sin and take us away from brokenness.  
But how? How could Jesus do all this?

Jesus lived a perfect life. Jesus was the only person who never sinned.  
He was the only person who stayed in God’s perfect design. Then Jesus gave up His perfect life and took our place.

He died on a cross to pay the price for our sin.  
So Jesus, God’s Son, canceled our sin with His death.

Three days after Jesus died and was buried, He rose from the dead.  
Because of His great sacrifice, God made Jesus the king of everything in Heaven and everything on Earth.

King Jesus made a way out of brokenness for us. God said that if we turn from our sin and believe that Jesus died for us, and are baptized in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, then God raises us, just like Jesus, to walk in a new kind of life as part of God’s family forever.

We then model this new life in the broken world, and await Jesus’ return when He will make a new Heaven and new Earth where we can be with Him forever in perfect wholeness.

God wants us to grow in our relationship with Him. God wants us restored back into His original perfect design.

As part of God’s family, Jesus gives us a mission, a reason for living, and a way to live the best possible life.

Jesus’ mission for us is to go. Jesus sends us, just like His Father, God, sent Him, back into brokenness to help others break free and become part of God’s forever family too.

In this Three Circles world, there are only two kinds of people:  

1. People who are a part of God’s perfect design, living out God’s rescue mission, helping reconnect God to His forever family.  
2. People who are still in brokenness, trying everything to break free, hoping that someone will save them.

Do you know where you are now? Do you know where you want to be?

There are many ways to share God’s story. The important thing is to share.  
God uses hearts willing to share to work on hearts willing to hear. It’s His work; He just invites us to join in.

## READ (5 min)

### Baptism

Jesus said – “go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit…”

Baptism – or “Baptizo” in the original language – means a drenching or submerging – like when you dye a cloth and it soaks in the color and comes out transformed.

Baptism is a picture of our new life, soaked in the image of Jesus, transformed in obedience to God. It is a picture of our death to sin, just as Jesus died for our sins; a burial of our old way of life, just as Jesus was buried; a rebirth to a new life in Christ, just as Jesus was resurrected and lives today.

If you have never baptized someone before, it may seem intimidating, but it shouldn’t be. Here are some simple steps.

1. Find some standing water, deep enough to allow the new disciple to be submerged.  
   This could be a pond, river, lake or ocean. It could be a bathtub or another way to gather water.
2. Let the disciple hold one of your hands with theirs and support their back with the other.
3. Ask two questions like these to make sure they understand their decision.  
   “Have you received Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior?”  
   “Will you obey and serve Him as your King for the rest of your life?”
4. If they answer “Yes,” to both, then say something like this:  
   “Because you’ve professed your faith in the Lord Jesus, I now baptize you in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.”
5. Help them lower into the water, submerge completely and raise them back up.

You’ve baptized a new follower of Jesus – a new citizen of heaven – a new child of the Living God. It’s time to celebrate!

Baptism – the first sacrament Jesus gave His followers and a foundation of the Zúme Toolkit.

---

## DISCUSS (10 min)

- Have you ever baptized someone?  
- Would you even consider it?  
- If the Great Commission is for every follower of Jesus, does that mean every follower is allowed to baptize others? Why or why not?

**IMPORTANT REMINDER – Have you been baptized?**  
If not, then we encourage you to plan this before even one more session of this training. Invite your group to be a part of this important day when you celebrate saying “yes” to Jesus.

---

## NEXT STEP

**IMPORTANT REMINDER – Your group will be celebrating the Lord’s Supper next session. Be sure to remember the supplies (bread and wine / juice).**
