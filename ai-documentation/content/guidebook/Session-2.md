## READ – Producer Not Consumer  

In this session we’ll talk about how we can help a follower of Jesus become a **PRODUCER** in God’s kingdom instead of simply a **CONSUMER**.

> In His perfect plan, God created us to live in balance — to **PRODUCE** and to **CONSUME**, to **CREATE** and to **USE UP**, to **POUR OUT** and to be **FILLED** so we can **POUR OUT again**.  
> But in our broken world many spend their energy living out just part of God’s perfect equation.  
> They **LEARN** but they don’t share.  
> They are **FILLED UP** but never pour out.  
> They **CONSUME** but don’t produce.

If we’re going to make disciples who multiply, then we need to share with them how they can be producers and not just consumers.

### How God Helps Us Become Producers

1. **Scripture** – The Written Word (The Bible) grows us spiritually.  
   - Every disciple needs to learn, interpret and apply Scripture.  
   - Over thousands of years many authors captured and shared what they heard.  
   - Scripture teaches us God’s story, plans, heart, and ways.

2. **Prayer** – The Spoken Word (discerned through prayer).  
   - Prayer is speaking and listening to God.  
   - It helps us know Him more intimately, understand His will, minister and serve others.

3. **The Church** – The Body of Believers.  
   - We are connected as one body in Jesus.  
   - Submit, serve, and use our strengths to help others.

4. **Persecution & Suffering** – Sacrifice and loss on behalf of Jesus.  
   - God refines our character, strengthens faith, equips us for ministry.

### Simple Tools to Become Producers

- **3/3rds Groups**  
- **Accountability Groups**  
- **Peer Mentoring**

These tools encourage us to obey God’s commands, share what we learn, and help each other grow.

## DISCUSS – Which Areas Do You Practice?

- Of the four areas (prayer, God’s Word, body life, persecution & suffering), which ones do you already practice?  
- Which ones do you feel unsure about?  
- How ready do you feel when it comes to training others?

## READ – Prayer Cycle

Jesus taught His followers about the purpose, practice and promises of prayer.  
He said: *“Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened.”*

Prayer is a direct, ongoing conversation with our Father in heaven.  
The **Prayer Cycle** is a simple tool for practicing prayer—12 steps, 5 minutes each, totaling an hour.

### The Prayer Cycle – One More Simple Tool in the Zúme Toolkit

---

## ACTIVITY – Prayer Cycle (60 min)

1. **Set a time** for the group to return and reconnect.  
2. Pray the Prayer Cycle individually for an hour.  
3. Add extra minutes for everyone to find a quiet place and return.

### Steps of the Prayer Cycle

| # | Action |
|---|--------|
| 1 | **PRAISE** – Start your prayer hour by praising the Lord. Praise Him for things that are on your mind right now, a special thing He has done in the past week, and His goodness to your family. |
| 2 | **WAIT** – Spend time waiting on the Lord; be silent and let Him pull together reflections for you. |
| 3 | **CONFESS** – Ask the Holy Spirit to show you anything in your life that might be displeasing to Him. Confess it to the Lord so you may be cleansed. |
| 4 | **READ THE WORD** – Spend time reading Psalms, prophets, or passages on prayer in the New Testament. |
| 5 | **ASK** – Make requests for yourself. |
| 6 | **INTERCESSION** – Make requests on behalf of others. |
| 7 | **PRAY THE WORD** – Pray specific passages, scriptural prayers and Psalms. |
| 8 | **THANK** – Give thanks to the Lord for the things in your life, for your family and church. |
| 9 | **SING** – Sing songs of praise or worship, or another hymn or spiritual song. |
| 10 | **MEDITATE** – Ask the Lord to speak to you; have a pen and paper ready to record impressions. |
| 11 | **LISTEN** – Merge what you have read, prayed and sung; see how the Lord brings them together. |
| 12 | **PRAISE** – Praise the Lord for the time you have had with Him and the impressions He has given you. |

## DISCUSS – After the Prayer Hour

- What is your reaction to spending an hour in prayer?  
- How do you feel?  
- Did you learn or hear anything?  
- What would life be like if you made this kind of prayer a regular habit?

## READ – List of 100

Jesus said, *“Go and make disciples…”*  
His followers obeyed. They went to family, friends, neighbors, coworkers and classmates—people we already know.

Being faithful with the people God has already put in our lives is a great first step in multiplying disciples.  
A **List of 100** is a simple tool that multiplies disciples.

## ACTIVITY – Create Your Own List of 100 (30 min)

Take the next 30 minutes to fill out your own list of relationships.  
List as many as you can, then mark your best understanding of their relationship to God: **Disciple**, **Unbeliever**, or **Unknown**.
