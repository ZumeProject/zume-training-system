## Look Back (5 min)

Before getting started, take some time to look back.  
At the end of the last session, everyone in your group was challenged to practice what you learned.  
Take a few moments to see how your group did this week.

## Overview (1 min)

In this session, we will hear and discuss this concept: **The Training Cycle**.  
And we will add this tool to our toolkit: **3/3 Group Meeting**.

## Read (5 min)

### The Training Cycle

In this session, we’ll learn **THE TRAINING CYCLE** that helps disciples go from one to many and turns a mission into a movement.

> Have you ever learned how to ride a bicycle?  
> Have you ever helped someone else learn?  
> If so, chances are you already know THE TRAINING CYCLE.  
> It’s as easy as **MODEL, ASSIST, WATCH and LEAVE**.

- **Modeling** is simply showing someone else an example of how it’s done.  
  When a child first sees someone else riding a bike, they get the idea right away.  
  Modeling is like that – it doesn’t have to be done often, and usually it only needs to be done once.

- **Assisting** is allowing a learner to practice a skill but making sure the falls aren’t too hard.  
  Assisting takes longer than modeling, but not too long. It requires some hand‑holding, direction and coaching, but it’s just about passing on the basics.  
  It’s not about getting someone to perfect; it’s about getting them to pedal.

- **Watching** is influencing a learner until they’re competent in their skill, all without having to step in and take control.  
  Watching is about making sure someone’s going to be safe – even when no one’s around.  
  Watching is about making sure not just that someone knows what to do, but also that they’ll do it – even when no one’s looking.

- **Leaving** is like a graduation. A student becomes a teacher, a worker becomes a co‑worker, a disciple becomes a friend.  
  In bike riding, the one who teaches you to ride doesn’t go along for every ride you take.  
  Leaving is about giving one last gift to someone you love – the gift of freedom.

> **MODEL, ASSIST, WATCH and LEAVE.**  
> The Training Cycle: From one to many. From a mission to a movement.

### Discussion (10 min)

Have you ever been a part of a Training Cycle?  
Who did you train? Or who trained you? Could the same person be at different parts of the Training Cycle while learning different skills?  
What would it look like to train someone like that?

## Activity (60–90 min)

### 3/3 Group Meeting

### Looking Back

1. **Giving Thanks**  
   Take some time to have each person share something they are thankful for.

2. **Sharing your Struggles and Praying for One Another**  
   Have each person in your group briefly share something they are struggling with.  
   Have someone else pray for them about what they share.

3. **Focusing the Group**  
   Take time and remember why you’re together – to love God, to love others, to share Jesus, and help others share Him too.

4. **Checking In**  
   Have each person answer the following questions:  
   - How have you obeyed what you’ve learned so far?  
   - Who have you trained in what you’ve learned?  
   - Who have you shared your story or God’s story with since we’ve been together as a group?

---

### Looking Up

1. **Invite God’s Holy Spirit to Lead**  
   Take a moment to pray. Talk with God simply and briefly. Ask His Holy Spirit to teach you from the passage you are about to read.

2. **Read God’s Word and Ask Questions**  
   Have someone in the group read from the Bible. When you’ve finished reading, the group should answer these two questions:  
   - What did you like about this passage?  
   - What did you find challenging or hard to understand?  

   Read the same passage a second time, and then have the group answer these two questions:  
   - What can we learn about people from this passage?  
   - What can we learn about God from this passage?  

   Remember stick to the passage and keep it simple!

---

### Looking Forward

1. **Praying for God’s Purpose**  
   Have each person in your group pray silently and ask God these questions:  
   - *God, how can I obey and apply what You’re teaching me?*  
   - *Who can I train from this passage so they can learn to obey and love You more?*  
   - *Who would you have me share my testimony or Your Good News of Jesus with?*  

   Ask God’s Holy Spirit to give you specific answers, specific names, and specific steps that you can take in the time between now and when your group meets again.

2. **Gathering Commitments**  
   Ask each person in your group to share what they heard from the Lord for each question. Someone may not have heard anything from the Lord on one, two, or even all three questions. They can simply report that they didn’t hear.  
   But remember, the group should hear from the Lord. Jesus said – “My sheep hear My voice.” And the more specific your obedience steps are, the easier it will be to obey them before we meet again.

3. **Practicing your Plan**  
   Before you end your time together, have your 3/3 Group break into smaller groups of two or three and practice what you’ve heard the Lord ask you to do.
