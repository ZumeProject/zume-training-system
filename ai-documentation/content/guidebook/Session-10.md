### Leadership in Networks

- In this session, we’ll learn how LEADERSHIP IN NETWORKS allows a growing group of small churches to work together, grow new leaders and accomplish even more of the good things God has planned for His people.
- So what happens to churches as they grow and start new churches that start new churches that start new churches? How do they stay connected? How do they live life together as an extended spiritual family?
- The answer is that all of these simple churches are just like the cells in a growing body and they connect and network into a city or regional church. The churches are related. They share the same spiritual DNA. They are all connected out of the same first multiplying family.
- And now -- with some guidance -- they come together as a larger body to do even more. At the city and regional level, God’s Word shows that the growing body of believers is served by a new group of leaders.
- In the New Testament, the church calls these servants Elders and Deacons, Shepherds and Overseers of the flock.
- We learn in God’s Word that the multitude of small home churches in the city of Jerusalem were served by a group of 7 servants -- or deacons.
- We learn in God’s Word that the multitude of home churches in the city of Ephesus were served by a small group of Elders -- shepherds who were to follow the model of the Good Shepherd Jesus and lay down their lives for their flock.
- In the city or region, we also see a group of five leadership gifts given. God’s Word says -- Christ Himself gave the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, the pastors and teachers, to equip his people for works of service, so that the body of Christ may be built up.
- These spiritual gifts are given not so a small group can do all the work of the church but so they could serve and prepare the followers of Jesus to do the work -- so the whole body of believers could work together to accomplish all God has in His heart to do.
- In addition to or in place of meeting with their own spiritual family, these leaders meet and pray and fellowship and encourage one another in much the same way that any simple church in a home would.
- The 3/3rds pattern is used in leadership training meetings and peer mentoring. The Four Fields pattern is used for planning, evaluation and coaching at higher levels just as it is at the local level.
- When the leaders meet they share what is happening not only as individuals but also across their network. They represent the families and share about the well‑being of the ones they serve.
- A good place for a network of spiritual families to center is the place where that network starts. A church network that launches from Tampa will start as a city church in Tampa.
- As they grow and serve throughout the state, they will act on behalf of the network in Florida. As they send and serve around the country and around the world, they begin to function at a national or even international level.
- Jesus said - If you’re faithful in little things, you will be faithful in large ones.
- These networks of churches remain connected because of their common spiritual DNA and shared beginnings. Sometimes the networks split off into multiple networks based on language, opportunities to meet or other reasons.
- This is part of growth and not a problem. The willingness of simple churches and individual followers to learn, obey and share God’s Word is the spiritual DNA of a movement.
- If it is passed on successfully from generation to generation, from church to church and from believer to believer then everything needed to begin a new movement of multiplying disciples is already present in every spiritual family and in every follower of Jesus.
- When movements launch movements, that’s when... we start to see the “leaven” working through the dough of a city or a state or even a nation. That is how the Kingdom of God comes in such a way that God’s will is being done on earth as it is in heaven.
- That is how we can finish the Great Commission by making disciples of all nations.

## DISCUSS (10 min)

- Are there advantages when networks of simple churches are connected by deep, personal relationships? What are some examples that come to mind?

## READ (5 min)

### Peer Mentoring Groups

- Jesus said - “A new command I give you: Love one another. As I have loved you, so you must love one another. By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you love one another.”
- A Peer Mentoring Group is a group that consists of people who are leading and starting 3/3 Groups. It also follows a 3/3 format and is a powerful way to assess the spiritual health of God’s work in your area.
- Peer Mentoring Groups use leader‑to‑leader mentoring with individual followers of Jesus, with simple churches, with ministry organizations or even with a global simple church network that reaches around the world.
- Peer Mentoring Groups follow Jesus’ example of ministry from scripture, ask questions of one another and give feedback -- all using the same basic time structure as a 3/3 Group. The purpose of these groups is not to judge - to lift one member up and tear another down.
- Jesus said - “Do not judge, or you too will be judged. For in the same way you judge others, you will be judged, and with the measure you use, it will be measured to you.”
- Instead, the purpose of a Peer Mentoring Group is to provide a simple format for helping followers of Jesus grow through prayer, obedience, application and accountability. In other words -- “to love one another.”
- Here’s how it works:
  - LOOK BACK: During the first third - spend time in prayer and care just like you would in a basic 3/3 Group. Then spend time looking at the group’s vision - How well are we individually abiding in Jesus as we read scripture, pray, trust and obey God, and live out key relationships? Finally during this first third, have the group review and respond to each individual’s action plans and commitments made in the last session.
  - LOOK UP: The middle third of the group’s time is spent Looking Up for God’s wisdom and direction through scripture, discussion and prayer. Offer a brief and simple prayer, asking God to teach you His will and His ways through His Word. Ask the Holy Spirit to lead your time.
    - Group members should share what they have learned from the Lord about their area of leadership - either through God’s Word, Prayer or from Other Followers.
    - Have the group discuss the following simple questions:
      1. How are you doing in each section of the Four Fields diagram?
      2. What is working well? What are your biggest challenges?
      3. Review your current generational map.
      4. What challenged you or what did you find hard to understand?
      5. What is God showing you recently?
      6. Are there any questions and feedback from seasoned leaders or other participants?
  - LOOK FORWARD: The final third of the group’s time is spent Looking Forward to how we can each apply and obey what we’ve learned. Spend time in silent prayer with everyone in the group asking the Holy Spirit to show them how to answer these questions:
    - What action plans or goals would God have me put into practice before our next time together? (Use the Four Fields tool to help focus your work)
    - How can my Mentor or other Group Members help me in this work?
    - Finally spend time as a group talking to God in prayer. Have the group pray so that each member is prayed for and ask God to prepare the hearts of all those the group will reach out to during their time apart.
    - Pray for God to give each member of the group the courage and strength to apply and obey what God has taught them in this session.
    - If a seasoned leader needs to pray specifically for a younger leader, this is the perfect time for that prayer.
    - Since these groups often meet at a distance, you are unlikely to be able to celebrate The Lord’s Supper or share a meal, but be sure to make time to check‑in about health and family and friends.
- Jesus showed us again and again that even though He accomplished the most important works, He balanced it, always, with time for the ones He loved. A Peer Mentoring Group is a simple but strategic tool from the Zúme Toolbox to develop stronger leaders.

## ACTIVITY (45 min)

### Peer Mentoring Group Practice

- Break into groups of two or three. Use the 3/3 formatted Peer Mentoring Group outline.
- Three-Month Plan
- In His Bible, God says, "I know the plans I have for you, plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future."
- God makes plans, and He expects us to make plans, too.
- A Three Month Plan is a tool you can use to help focus your attention and efforts and keep them aligned with God’s priorities for making disciples who multiply.
- Choose one person in the group to be the "mentee" and have the other members work through the suggested questions list as peer mentors.
- Simple format for leading a Peer Mentoring Group:
  - LOOK BACK – 1/3 of your time
    - During the first third – spend time in prayer and care just like you would in a basic 3/3 Group. Then spend time looking at the group’s vision and faithfulness in previous commitments: How well are you abiding in Christ? [Scripture, prayer, trust, obedience, key relationships?] Did your group complete your action plans from the last session? Review them.
  - LOOK UP – 1/3 of your time
    - Have the group discuss the following simple questions:
      1. How are you doing in each section of the Four Fields diagram?
      2. What is working well? What are your biggest challenges?
      3. Review your current generational map.
      4. What challenged you or what did you find hard to understand?
      5. What is God showing you recently?
      6. Are there any questions from seasoned leaders or other participants?
  - LOOK FORWARD – 1/3 of your time
    - Spend time in silent prayer with everyone in the group asking the Holy Spirit to show them how to answer these questions:
      - What action plans or goals would God have me put into practice before our next time together? [Use the Four Fields tool to help focus your work]
      - How can my Mentor or other Group Members help me in this work?
    - Finally spend time as a group talking to God in prayer. Have the group pray so that each member is prayed for and ask God to prepare the hearts of all those the group will reach out to during their time apart. Pray for God to give each member of the group the courage and strength to apply and obey what God has taught them in this session. If a seasoned leader needs to pray specifically for a younger leader, this is the perfect time for that prayer. Since these groups often meet at a distance, you are unlikely to be able to celebrate The Lord’s Supper or share a meal, but be sure to make time to check‑in about health and family and friends. The next slide will show you how to make your Three Month Plan. We recommend using the online tool.
