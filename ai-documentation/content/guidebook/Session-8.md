## OVERVIEW (1 min)

- In this session, we will hear and discuss this concept: **Leadership Cells**  
- And we will practice this tool from our toolkit: **3/3 Group Meeting**

## READ (5 min)

### Leadership Cells

In this session, we’ll learn how **LEADERSHIP CELLS** prepare followers in a short time to become leaders for a lifetime. One becomes two. Two becomes four. Four becomes eight. This is individual multiplication, generational increase, and exponential growth. This is the model God built into His creation and the way He intends His family to grow.

We’ve already learned the 3/3rds pattern that turns consumers into producers, learners into leaders, and disciples into disciple‑makers: Look Back – Look Up – Look Forward. Learn – Obey – Share. This way of meeting together produces ongoing spiritual growth in individual believers and ongoing reproductive growth in a group of followers of Jesus. This pattern helps disciples multiply.

But what if a group is together for only a short period of time? Can they still grow and reproduce God’s Kingdom? Leadership Cells are a way to put the 3/3rds pattern to work when you know there’s a limit to how long a group can be together. Leadership Cells equip individual believers in a short time to learn reproductive patterns that last a lifetime. They help learners become leaders who will then start new groups, train new churches, and begin more Leadership Cells to grow God’s family.

Leadership Cells work well when a group is mobile. Nomads, students, military personnel, and seasonal workers who already follow Jesus are great candidates for a Leadership Cell. Because of their culture, profession, or season of life, they may have a hard time establishing an ongoing group, but they can absolutely be trained to start groups in each place they travel.

Leadership Cells also work well when a group of people come to faith at the same time. A family, a network of friends, or even a small village can be trained in a short time to become producers for a lifetime—even without individual follow‑ups or spiritual coaching.

In an earlier session, we learned and practiced the last two parts of the 3/3rds pattern. Now we will practice the entire pattern—all three parts: looking back, looking up, and looking forward.

## DISCUSS (10 min)

- Is there a group of followers of Jesus you know that are already meeting or would be willing to meet and form a Leadership Cell to learn Zúme Training?  
- What would it take to bring them together?

## ACTIVITY (60–90 min)

### 3/3 Group Meeting

- **LOOK BACK** – Use last session’s Obey, Train, and Share challenges to check‑in with each other. (30 min)  
- **LOOK UP** – Use Acts 2:42‑47 as your group’s reading passage and answer questions 1–4. (30 min)  
- **LOOK FORWARD** – Use questions 5, 6, and 7 to develop how you will Obey, Train and Share. (30 min)

#### LOOKING BACK

1. **Step 1 – Giving Thanks**  
   Take some time to have each person share something they are thankful for.

2. **Step 2 – Sharing your Struggles and Praying for One Another**  
   Have each person in your group briefly share something they are struggling with.  
   Have someone else pray for them about what they share.

3. **Step 3 – Focusing the Group**  
   Take time and remember why you’re together – to love God, to love others, to share Jesus, and help others share Him too.

4. **Step 4 – Checking In**  
   Have each person answer the following questions:  
   - How have you obeyed what you’ve learned so far?  
   - Who have you trained in what you’ve learned?  
   - Who have you shared your story or God’s story with since we’ve been together as a group?

#### LOOKING UP

1. **Step 1 – Invite God’s Holy Spirit to Lead**  
   Take a moment to pray. Talk with God simply and briefly. Ask His Holy Spirit to teach you from the passage you are about to read.

2. **Step 2 – Read God’s Word and Ask Questions**  
   Have someone in the group read from the Bible. When you’ve finished reading, the group should answer these two questions:  
   - What did you like about this passage?  
   - What did you find challenging or hard to understand?  

   Read the same passage a second time, and then have the group answer these two questions:  
   - What can we learn about people from this passage?  
   - What can we learn about God from this passage?  

   Remember stick to the passage and keep it simple!

#### LOOKING FORWARD

1. **Step 1 – Praying for God’s Purpose**  
   Have each person in your group pray silently and ask God these questions:  
   - God, how can I obey and apply what You’re teaching me?  
   - Who can I train from this passage so they can learn to obey and love You more?  
   - Who would you have me share my testimony or Your Good News of Jesus with?  

   Ask God’s Holy Spirit to give you specific answers, specific names, and specific steps that you can take in the time between now and when your group meets again.

2. **Step 2 – Gathering Commitments**  
   Ask each person in your group to share what they heard from the Lord for each question. Someone may not have heard anything from the Lord on one, two, or even all three questions. They can simply report that they didn’t hear.  
   But remember, the group should hear from the Lord. Jesus said – “My sheep hear My voice.” And the more specific your obedience steps are, the easier it will be to obey them before we meet again.

3. **Step 3 – Practicing your Plan**  
   Before you end your time together, have your 3/3 Group break into smaller groups of two or three and practice what you’ve heard the Lord ask you to do.

## NEXT STEP REVIEW (1 min)

- **Concept from this session:** Leadership Cells  
- **Tool from this session:** 3/3 Group Meeting

## OBEY

Select some people from your List of 100 who are already believers. Explain Leadership Cells to them and see if they would be interested to be part of one.

## SHARE

Pray and ask God who He wants you to share the Leadership Cell tool with before your group meets again. Challenge them to then share it with someone else.
