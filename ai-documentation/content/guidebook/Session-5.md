## READ (5 min) – Prayer Walking

> **Prayer Walking**  
> God’s Word says that we should “petition, pray, intercede and give thanksgiving for all people, for kings and all those in authority – that we may live peaceful and quiet lives in all godliness and holiness. This is good, and pleases God our Savior, who wants all people to be saved and to come to a knowledge of the truth.”  

Prayer Walking is a simple way to obey God’s command to pray for others. It’s just what it sounds like—praying to God while walking around.  
Instead of closing our eyes and bowing our heads, we keep our eyes open to the needs we see around us and bow our hearts to ask humbly for God to intervene.  

- **You can prayer walk** in small groups of two or three, or you can pray by yourself.  
  - If you go in a group—try having everyone pray out loud, a conversation with God about what everyone is seeing and the needs that God brings to their hearts.  
  - If you go by yourself—pray silently or out loud if you pray with someone you meet along the way.

### How to know what to pray for during your prayer walk

| Source | What it looks like |
|--------|--------------------|
| **Observation** | What do you see? If you see a child’s toy in a yard, you might be prompted to pray for the neighborhood’s children, families or schools. |
| **Research** | What do you know? If you’ve read up about the neighborhood, you might know something about the people who live there or if the area suffers from crime or injustice. Pray about these things and ask God to act. |
| **Revelation** | The Holy Spirit may nudge your heart or bring an idea to mind for a particular need or area of prayer. Listen—and pray! |
| **Scripture** | You may have read part of God’s Word in preparation for your walk or as you walk, the Holy Spirit may bring a Scripture to mind. Pray about that passage and how it might impact the people in that area. |

### Five areas of influence to focus on during your prayer walk

1. **Government** – Look for and pray over government centers such as courthouses, commission buildings or law‑enforcement offices. Pray for the area’s protection, for justice and for godly wisdom for its leaders.
2. **Business & Commerce** – Look for and pray over commercial centers such as financial districts or shopping areas. Pray for righteous investments, good stewardship of resources, economic justice and opportunity, and for generous and godly givers who put people before profits.
3. **Education** – Look for and pray over educational centers such as schools, administration buildings, vocational training centers, community colleges and universities. Pray for righteous educators to teach God’s truth and protect the minds of their students; pray that God would intervene in every effort to promote lies or confusion. Pray that these places would send out wise citizens who have a heart to serve and lead.
4. **Communication** – Look for and pray over communication centers such as radio stations, TV stations and newspaper publishers. Pray that God’s story and the testimony of His followers be spread throughout the city and around the world. Pray that His message is delivered through His medium to His multitudes and that God’s people everywhere will see God’s work.
5. **Spirituality** – Look for and pray over spiritual centers such as church buildings, mosques or temples. Pray that every spiritual seeker would find peace and comfort in Jesus and not be distracted or confused by any false religion.

### How to pray for people you meet during your prayer walk

- **Be alert** for opportunities and listen for promptings by God’s Spirit to pray for individuals and groups you meet along the way.  
- You can say, “We’re praying for this community— is there anything in particular we can pray for you about?” or “I’m praying for this area. Do you know anything in particular we should pray for?”  
- After listening to their response, ask about their own needs. If they share, pray for them right away.  
- If the Lord leads, you may pray about other needs as well.

### Using the word **BLESS** to remember 5 different ways you can pray

| BLESS | What it covers |
|-------|----------------|
| **Body** | Health |
| **Labor** | Job and finances |
| **Emotional** | Morale |
| **Social** | Relationships |
| **Spiritual** | Knowing and loving God more |

- In most cases, people are grateful you care enough to pray.  
- If the person is not a Christian, your prayer may open the door to a spiritual conversation and an opportunity to share your story and God’s story. You can invite them to be a part of a Bible study or even host one in their home.  
- If the person is a Christian you can invite them to join your prayer walk or train them how they can prayer‑walk and use simple steps like praying for areas of influence or the BLESS prayer to grow God’s family even more.

## READ (5 min) – Person of Peace

Welcome back to Zúme Training. In an earlier session you were introduced to the idea of a **Person of Peace**. In this session we’ll go into more detail about who that person might be and how to know when you’ve found one.

A Person of Peace can help rapidly reproduce disciple‑making even in a place where followers of Jesus are few and far between.

When Jesus sent out His disciples to new territory to make disciples, He gave them a simple but strategic command:

> “Carry no money belt, no bag, no shoes; greet no one on the way. Whatever house you enter, first say, ‘Peace be to this house.’ If a man of peace is there, your peace will rest on him; but if not, it will return to you. Stay in that same house, eating and drinking what they give you; for the laborer is worthy of his wages. Do not keep moving from house to house.”

But what does all that mean?

When we think of making disciples, our first thought might be – “We better get our finances in order, pick an obvious target, and have a clear plan of action.” If Jesus said – “Go,” we better “go” and keep on going! Tell Everyone! Everywhere!! All the time!!!

But Jesus, in His instructions, seemed a lot less worried about finances and fervor, and a lot more concerned about focus. Jesus wanted His disciples looking for – and investing in – a Person of Peace.

When you want to make disciples in a place where not many – or maybe even any – exist, then looking for a Person of Peace might be the most important thing you do.

### A Person of Peace is

1. **Someone who is OPEN** to hearing your story, God’s story and the Good News of Jesus.  
2. **Someone who is HOSPITABLE** and welcomes you into their home or workplace or to join events with family and friends.  
3. **Someone who KNOWS OTHERS** (or is KNOWN BY OTHERS) and who is excited to draw together a small group or even a crowd.  
4. **Someone who is FAITHFUL** and shares what they learn with others – even after you’re gone.

In the Bible, we learn of Jesus and His followers meeting Persons of Peace that are a little – unexpected. In the region of the Gadarenes, Jesus met a demon‑possessed man who lived isolated and in chains. We would never think of Him as a Person of Peace, but He was OPEN to hear from Jesus. He was HOSPITABLE and welcomed Jesus where He lived. He was WELL‑KNOWN and could easily draw a crowd – even if only for his outrageous behavior.

Jesus found that he was FAITHFUL and SHARED what Jesus meant to him with his family, his community and his whole country. In fact, when Jesus came back to that area, a great crowd gathered, excited to see the man they had heard so much about.

In Samaria, Jesus met a woman at a well. She was OPEN to Jesus, willing to be HOSPITABLE and answer His request for a drink. We learn she had five husbands and was living with still another man, and so in a small town, she was sure to be KNOWN BY OTHERS. And after Jesus spoke to her, she was FAITHFUL and SHARED – so much and so quickly that the entire town asked Jesus to stay and share with them, too. And He did.

So, if a Person of Peace can live almost anywhere, do almost anything, and be almost anyone we know or meet – how do we find one?

### Three simple ways

1. **ASK** for recommendations from people in the community – “Who’s someone that’s trusted here? Is there someone in this place who thinks of others before themselves?” If you hear the same name again and again – try to meet them, share spiritual ideas, and see if they’re open to hear and share.  
2. **OFFER** to pray for someone while Prayer Walking, or at work, or at the game – wherever there’s an opportunity – and then turn that prayer into a spiritual conversation.  
3. **INTRODUCE** spiritual ideas into every conversation to see if God is working in a person’s life. If they are open and willing, then we ask if they would be willing to gather a group to discuss even more.

> **ASK** for recommendations, **OFFER** to pray, **INTRODUCE** spiritual ideas.  
> These are all ways we can begin the process of finding a Person of Peace.

And no matter how we find them, remember Jesus said a Person of Peace is someone we should be spending most of our disciple‑making time with.

It’s easy to think that the most “fair” use of our time is to give a little bit of ourselves to everyone, equally. But Jesus said – and showed – that He doesn’t want us to be shallow with everyone but to give deeply to a few.

Jesus often attracted crowds, but the Bible tells us again and again that Jesus would draw away from those crowds to spend most of His time with just twelve of His closest followers.

There were a number of times where Jesus would invest even more time with a smaller group of just three.

If Jesus, who had much more power, much more energy, much more authority, discipline, wisdom, knowledge, understanding and compassion chose to spend His time investing deeply in just a few and told His own disciples to do the same, doesn’t it make sense that we should follow and share His perfect pattern?

A Person of Peace.  
They’re not easy to find – maybe one in a thousand. But like a hidden treasure that’s worth the search, their value in growing God’s family can’t be measured.

## DISCUSS (10 min)

- **Can someone who has a “bad reputation”** (like the Samaritan woman or the demon‑possessed man in the Gadarenes) really be a Person of Peace? Why or why not?  
- **What is a community or segment of society near you that seems to have little (or no) Kingdom presence?**  
- **How could a Person of Peace (someone who is OPEN, HOSPITABLE, KNOWS OTHERS and SHARES) accelerate the spread of the Gospel in that community?**

---

## ACTIVITY (10 min) – Practice the B.L.E.S.S. Prayer

Break into groups of two or three and practice praying the five areas of the B.L.E.S.S. Prayer over each other.

### The BLESS prayer pattern

> **Body** – health  
> **Labor** – job and finances  
> **Emotional** – morale  
> **Social** – relationships  
> **Spiritual** – knowing and loving God more  

---

## ACTIVITY (60–90 min) – Prayer Walking

Break into groups of two or three and go out into the community to practice Prayer Walking.

- Choosing a location can be as simple as walking outside from where you are now, or you could plan to go to a specific destination.  
- Go as God leads, and plan on spending 60–90 minutes on this activity.  
- This session ends with the prayer walking activity.

### Four sources that can guide your prayer

1. **Observation** – What do you see?  
2. **Research** – What do you know?  
3. **Revelation** – The Holy Spirit may nudge your heart or bring an idea to mind for a particular need or area of prayer.  
4. **Scripture** – You may have read part of God’s Word in preparation for your walk or as you walk; the Holy Spirit may bring a Scripture to mind.

### Five areas of influence on which to focus prayer

1. **Government** – Look for and pray over government centers such as courthouses, commission buildings or law‑enforcement offices. Pray for the area’s protection, for justice and for godly wisdom for its leaders.  
2. **Business & Commerce** – Look for and pray over commercial centers such as financial districts or shopping areas. Pray for righteous investments, good stewardship of resources, economic justice and opportunity, and for generous and godly givers who put people before profits.  
3. **Education** – Look for and pray over educational centers such as schools, administration buildings, vocational training centers, community colleges and universities. Pray for righteous educators to teach God’s truth and protect the minds of their students; pray that God would intervene in every effort to promote lies or confusion. Pray that these places would send out wise citizens who have a heart to serve and lead.  
4. **Communication** – Look for and pray over communication centers such as radio stations, TV stations and newspaper publishers. Pray that God’s story and the testimony of His followers be spread throughout the city and around the world. Pray that His message is delivered through His medium to His multitudes and that God’s people everywhere will see God’s work.  
5. **Spirituality** – Look for and pray over spiritual centers such as church buildings, mosques or temples. Pray that every spiritual seeker would find peace and comfort in Jesus and not be distracted or confused by any false religion.

## PRAY (5 min)

Before you go out on your Prayer Walking activity, be sure to pray with your group to end your time together.

- Thank God that He loves the lost, the last and the least – including us!  
- Ask Him to prepare your heart and the hearts of those you’ll meet during your walk to be open to His work.
