## READ (5 min)

### God Uses Ordinary People

Welcome to Zúme training. **Zúme** is the Greek word for “yeast.”  

Jesus tells us that the Kingdom of God is like a woman who took a small amount of **zúme** and put it into a great amount of dough. As she worked the yeast into the mix, it spread until all of the dough was leavened. Jesus was showing us that an ordinary person can take something very small and use it to make a big impact!

Our dream is to do what Jesus said – to help ordinary people around the world use small tools to make a big impact in God’s kingdom!

Jesus’ final instructions to His followers were simple. He said — **All authority in heaven and earth has been given to Me. Therefore – Go and Make Disciples of all nations, baptizing Them in the name of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit, teaching them to obey all I have commanded, And I will be with you always - even to the end of the age.**

Jesus’ command was simple – **Make Disciples**  
His instructions on how to do that were simple – **Make disciples wherever you’re going. Make disciples by baptizing them in the name of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit. Make disciples by teaching them to obey all He commanded.**

So what are the steps to make a disciple?  
We make disciples all the time – wherever we’re going and as we go.  

When someone decides to follow Jesus, they should be baptized.  
As they grow – we should teach every disciple how to obey everything that Jesus commanded.

Since one of the things He commanded is to make disciples, that means every disciple who follows Jesus needs to learn how to make disciples too. Those disciples are to make disciples, and those disciples are to make disciples, too. **Multiplying disciples.** That’s how Zúme works – it’s like yeast, worked all through the dough until all of the dough is leavened.

When Jesus gave this command to go make disciples, He also gave a promise.  
Jesus said – *I will be with you always.* Even to the very end of the age. Every follower of Jesus should count on that promise because He is with us!  
But that also means every follower of Jesus should commit to the fact that Jesus wants each of us to make disciples. Because He does.

Jesus said – **All authority in heaven and earth has been given to Me.** Therefore go and make disciples.  
The authority that Jesus relies on when He sends us – is His authority. Jesus says there is no higher authority than that. No tradition, culture, or earthly law has more authority.

Jesus said – *Go and make disciples.* And like Zúme – like yeast – we’ll keep going and growing until all the work is done.

---

### Disciples and the Church

Welcome back to Zúme training. In this session, we’ll talk about disciples and the church.

**What is a disciple? And how do you make one? How do you teach a follower of Jesus to obey all of His commands? How do you take someone who’s lived their life as a captive of the world and equip them to become a citizen of God’s kingdom?**

The meaning of the word disciple is a follower. So a disciple is a follower of God. Jesus said – *All authority in heaven and earth has been given to Me.* So in God’s kingdom, Jesus is our King. We are His citizens, subjects of His will. His desires, purposes, intentions, priorities and values are the highest and best. His Word is the law.

So what is the law of the kingdom? What does Jesus tell His citizens to do?  
Jesus said – *Love the Lord God with all your heart, soul, mind and strength.* Jesus said – *Love your neighbor as yourself.* Jesus said that God’s commands from the Old Testament – all the law and the prophets – can be summarized in these two things – **Love God** and **Love People.** Jesus said – *Make disciples.* Jesus said – *Teach them to obey all that I’ve commanded.* Since making disciples includes teaching them all that Jesus commanded – the New Testament can be summarized in one thing – **Make Disciples.**

A disciple is a follower of Jesus who loves God, loves people and makes disciples.

**What is a church?**  
You may be used to thinking of the church as a building – a place where you go. But God’s Word talks about the church as a gathering – a people you belong to.

The word “church” is used in the Bible three different ways:

1. The **universal church** – all the people who were, are and will ever be followers of Jesus.  
2. The **city or regional church** – all the people who follow Jesus and live in or around a certain area of the world.  
3. The **church at home** – all the people who follow Jesus and meet where one or more of them live.

A spiritual family – followers of Jesus who love God, love people and make disciples – and who meet together locally make up this last kind of church – the **church at home** or the simple church.

When groups of these simple churches connect to do something bigger, together, they can form a city or regional church. All of those simple churches networked into regions and stretched across history make up the **universal church**.

> **THAT’S CHURCH WITH A CAPITAL “C”**

Simple churches are spiritual families with Jesus as their center and their king. Simple churches are spiritual families who love God, love others and make disciples who multiply. Some churches have buildings and programs and budgets and staff. But simple churches don’t need any of these things to love God, love others and make disciples who multiply. And since anything extra makes a church more complicated and harder to multiply, our training leaves things like buildings, programs, budgets and staff to the city or regional church built from multiplying simple churches.

Remember “zúme” means “yeast” – a single‑cell organism that reproduces quickly. With Zúme training, we’re going to be like that yeast – simple and multiplying. But before we start multiplying – let’s make sure we know what God wants reproduced. Because multiplication can be good, but not always. Cancer is multiplication. And it’s deadly. So how do we reproduce life and not death? And how do we make sure we’re disciples worth reproducing?

---

### Hearing and Obeying God

Welcome back to Zúme training. In this session, we’ll talk about hearing from God and obeying what we hear.

Breathing is life. We breathe in. We breathe out. Life.  
Breathing is just as important in God’s Kingdom. In fact, God calls His Spirit – “breath.”

In the Kingdom we breathe **IN** when we hear from God. We breathe in when we hear from God through His Word – the Bible. We breathe in when we hear from God through prayer – our conversations with Him. We breathe in when we hear from God through His body – the church, other followers of Jesus. We breathe in when we hear from God through His works – events, experiences and sometimes even the persecutions and sufferings He allows His children to go through.

In the Kingdom we breathe **OUT** when we act on what we hear from God. We breathe out when we obey.

Sometimes breathing out to obey means changing our thoughts, words or actions to bring them into alignment with Jesus and His will. Sometimes breathing out to obey means sharing what Jesus has shared with us – giving away what He gave us so that others can be blessed just as God is blessing us.

For a follower of Jesus – this breathing IN and breathing OUT is critical. It’s our very life.  
Jesus said – *The Son can do nothing by himself.* He does only what he sees the Father doing. Whatever the Father does, the Son also does.  
Jesus said – *I don’t speak on my own authority.* The Father who sent me has commanded what to say and how to say it.  
Jesus said that every word He spoke and every work He accomplished was based on hearing from God and obeying what He heard.

Breathe IN – hear from God. Breathe OUT – obey what you hear and share it with others.

Jesus said that His followers would also hear from God because of His Holy Spirit – His breath – that would be breathed into every one of us who follows Him.

Jesus said – *The Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, will teach you all things and remind you of everything that I have told you.* Breathe IN – hear from God. Breathe OUT – obey what you hear and share it with others.

Jesus was showing us how to live.  
So how do we hear God’s voice? How do we know what to obey?

Jesus called Himself “The Good Shepherd.” Jesus called His followers “His sheep.”  
Jesus said – *My sheep hear My voice, and I know them, and they follow Me.*  
Jesus said – *Whoever belongs to God hears what God says.* The reason you do not hear is that you do not belong to God.

As followers of Jesus, we have to be committed to hearing His voice.  
We HEAR His voice by being still.  
We HEAR His voice by focusing on Jesus.  
We HEAR His voice in our thoughts, our visions, our feelings and impressions.  
We HEAR His voice when we write down and test what we hear.

Not every voice, not every thought, not every vision, feeling or impression is God’s voice. Sometimes it is the voice of the enemy. Jesus said our enemy is a liar and the father of lies. Jesus said our enemy comes to steal, kill and destroy.

But God says that we **will** hear from Him and we will know it is Him when He speaks. With practice and prayer, we can learn to hear God’s voice better. We can learn to know whether what we hear is from God or another voice.

**Here are some ways to test what we hear:**

1. When Jesus speaks – His voice will always be consistent with what His Written Word – the Bible – has already told us.  
2. When Jesus speaks – His voice will give our hearts a sense of hope and peace.  
3. When Jesus speaks – His voice will not leave us condemned or discouraged. Jesus does not condemn; He corrects in love.  
4. When Jesus speaks – His voice will not express the works of the flesh – sexual immorality and impurity, debauchery, idolatry and witchcraft, hatred and discord, jealousy and fits of rage, selfish ambitions, dissensions, factions and envy, drunkenness and orgies. These things are not from God’s voice.  
5. When Jesus speaks – His voice will express the fruit of God’s Spirit – love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self‑control.  
6. When Jesus speaks – His voice will give us a sense of confidence instead of doubt. We experience inside ourselves a knowledge and peace that what we’re hearing is from God.  
7. We may not hear everything at once. We may hear only part of what we eventually will need to know. But what we hear will be solid – not shifting or changing.

The good news for every follower of Jesus is that when we breathe IN and HEAR from God and when we breathe OUT and OBEY what we hear and SHARE with others what we’ve heard – God will speak even more clearly. His breath will breathe through us even more. We will HEAR His voice more clearly. We will KNOW His voice and not another’s. We will SEE His work in the world and be able to join in and work with Him.

## READ (5 min)

### S.O.A.P.S. Bible Reading

Jesus said – “make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit and teaching them to obey all that I commanded…”

If every follower of Jesus is going to obey all that Jesus commanded, then they need to know what Jesus commands. The Great Commandment and the Great Commission are a great summary of what God has to say to us, but if a follower is going to grow into the full measure of what God created them to be, then they need to know and obey even more.

**S.O.A.P.S.** stands for:

- **Scripture**  
- **Observation**  
- **Application**  
- **Prayer**  
- **Sharing**

It’s a simple way to learn and remember an effective Bible study method that any follower of Jesus can use.  

### When you read or listen to the Bible:

| Step | What to do |
|------|------------|
| **Scripture** | Write out one or more verses that are particularly meaningful to you, today. |
| **Observation** | Rewrite those verses or key points from those scriptures in your own words to help you better understand the meaning. |
| **Application** | Think about what it means to obey these commands or concepts in your own life. What would you have to do? What would you have to do differently? Write these down. |
| **Prayer** | Write out a prayer that tells God what you’ve read in His word and what you understand about obeying His commands and putting what you’ve learned to work. |
| **Sharing** | Ask God who He wants you to share with about what you’ve learned and how you’re applying it. |

---

### Example of S.O.A.P.S.

- **Scripture** – *“For my thoughts are not your thoughts, nor are your ways My ways,” declares the Lord. “For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are My ways higher than your ways and My thoughts than your thoughts.”* – Isaiah 55:8‑9  
- **Observation** – As a human, I’m limited in what I know and how I can act. God is not limited in any way. He sees and knows everything.  
- **Application** – Since God knows everything and His ways are best, I’ll have more success in life if I follow Him instead of relying on my own way.  
- **Prayer** – *Lord, I don’t know how to live a good life that pleases You and helps others. My ways lead to mistakes. My thoughts hurt. Please teach me Your ways and thoughts instead. Let your Holy Spirit guide me as I follow You.*  
- **Sharing** – I will share these verses and this application with my friend, Steve, who is going through a difficult time and needs direction for important decisions he’s facing.

---

## ACTIVITY (30 min)

## READ (5 min)

### Accountability Groups

Jesus said – “From everyone who has been given much, much will be demanded; and from the one who has been entrusted with much, much more will be asked.”

Jesus shared many stories of accountability and told us many truths about how we will be held responsible for what we do and say. Jesus tells us these things now so we can be ready later. And because we will be accountable to Him one day, it’s good to practice being accountable to one another now.

**Accountability Groups** are made up of two or three people of the same gender – men with men, women with women – who meet once a week to discuss a set of questions that help reveal areas where things are going right and other areas that need correction.

Every follower of Jesus will be held accountable, so every follower should practice accountability with others.

---

## ACTIVITY (20 min)

**Practice Accountability Groups**

1. **Break into groups of two or three people of the same gender.**  
2. **Spend the next 20 minutes working together through the Accountability Questions:**

> - List of 100

---

## READ – Producer Not Consumer  

In this session we’ll talk about how we can help a follower of Jesus become a **PRODUCER** in God’s kingdom instead of simply a **CONSUMER**.

> In His perfect plan, God created us to live in balance — to **PRODUCE** and to **CONSUME**, to **CREATE** and to **USE UP**, to **POUR OUT** and to be **FILLED** so we can **POUR OUT again**.  
> But in our broken world many spend their energy living out just part of God’s perfect equation.  
> They **LEARN** but they don’t share.  
> They are **FILLED UP** but never pour out.  
> They **CONSUME** but don’t produce.

If we’re going to make disciples who multiply, then we need to share with them how they can be producers and not just consumers.

### How God Helps Us Become Producers

1. **Scripture** – The Written Word (The Bible) grows us spiritually.  
   - Every disciple needs to learn, interpret and apply Scripture.  
   - Over thousands of years many authors captured and shared what they heard.  
   - Scripture teaches us God’s story, plans, heart, and ways.

2. **Prayer** – The Spoken Word (discerned through prayer).  
   - Prayer is speaking and listening to God.  
   - It helps us know Him more intimately, understand His will, minister and serve others.

3. **The Church** – The Body of Believers.  
   - We are connected as one body in Jesus.  
   - Submit, serve, and use our strengths to help others.

4. **Persecution & Suffering** – Sacrifice and loss on behalf of Jesus.  
   - God refines our character, strengthens faith, equips us for ministry.

### Simple Tools to Become Producers

- **3/3rds Groups**  
- **Accountability Groups**  
- **Peer Mentoring**

These tools encourage us to obey God’s commands, share what we learn, and help each other grow.

---

## DISCUSS – Which Areas Do You Practice?

- Of the four areas (prayer, God’s Word, body life, persecution & suffering), which ones do you already practice?  
- Which ones do you feel unsure about?  
- How ready do you feel when it comes to training others?

---

## READ – Prayer Cycle

Jesus taught His followers about the purpose, practice and promises of prayer.  
He said: *“Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened.”*

Prayer is a direct, ongoing conversation with our Father in heaven.  
The **Prayer Cycle** is a simple tool for practicing prayer—12 steps, 5 minutes each, totaling an hour.

### The Prayer Cycle – One More Simple Tool in the Zúme Toolkit

---

## ACTIVITY – Prayer Cycle (60 min)

1. **Set a time** for the group to return and reconnect.  
2. Pray the Prayer Cycle individually for an hour.  
3. Add extra minutes for everyone to find a quiet place and return.

### Steps of the Prayer Cycle

| # | Action |
|---|--------|
| 1 | **PRAISE** – Start your prayer hour by praising the Lord. Praise Him for things that are on your mind right now, a special thing He has done in the past week, and His goodness to your family. |
| 2 | **WAIT** – Spend time waiting on the Lord; be silent and let Him pull together reflections for you. |
| 3 | **CONFESS** – Ask the Holy Spirit to show you anything in your life that might be displeasing to Him. Confess it to the Lord so you may be cleansed. |
| 4 | **READ THE WORD** – Spend time reading Psalms, prophets, or passages on prayer in the New Testament. |
| 5 | **ASK** – Make requests for yourself. |
| 6 | **INTERCESSION** – Make requests on behalf of others. |
| 7 | **PRAY THE WORD** – Pray specific passages, scriptural prayers and Psalms. |
| 8 | **THANK** – Give thanks to the Lord for the things in your life, for your family and church. |
| 9 | **SING** – Sing songs of praise or worship, or another hymn or spiritual song. |
| 10 | **MEDITATE** – Ask the Lord to speak to you; have a pen and paper ready to record impressions. |
| 11 | **LISTEN** – Merge what you have read, prayed and sung; see how the Lord brings them together. |
| 12 | **PRAISE** – Praise the Lord for the time you have had with Him and the impressions He has given you. |

## DISCUSS – After the Prayer Hour

- What is your reaction to spending an hour in prayer?  
- How do you feel?  
- Did you learn or hear anything?  
- What would life be like if you made this kind of prayer a regular habit?

---

## READ – List of 100

Jesus said, *“Go and make disciples…”*  
His followers obeyed. They went to family, friends, neighbors, coworkers and classmates—people we already know.

Being faithful with the people God has already put in our lives is a great first step in multiplying disciples.  
A **List of 100** is a simple tool that multiplies disciples.

---

## ACTIVITY – Create Your Own List of 100 (30 min)

Take the next 30 minutes to fill out your own list of relationships.  
List as many as you can, then mark your best understanding of their relationship to God: **Disciple**, **Unbeliever**, or **Unknown**.

> *(Below is the template you can copy into a markdown table. Replace the blanks with your names.)*

## OVERVIEW (1 min)

- In this session, we will hear and discuss this concept: **Spiritual Economy**  
  And we will add these tools to our toolkit:  
  • The Gospel  
  • Baptism

## READ (5 min)

### Spiritual Economy

In this session, we’ll talk about God’s **SPIRITUAL ECONOMY**. In this broken world, people feel rewarded when they take, when they receive and when they gain more than those around them.

In His Scriptures, God tells His people – *My thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways My ways.*  
God shows us in His Kingdom economy we’re rewarded not by what we get – but by what we give away.  
God says – *I will save you, and you will be a blessing.* Jesus said – *It is better to give than to receive.*  

Giving away what God gives us and blessing others when God blesses us is the foundation for **the SPIRITUAL BREATHING** we learned about before. We breathe IN and HEAR from God.  
We breathe OUT and OBEY what we hear and SHARE with others.

When we are faithful to **OBEY** and **SHARE** what the Lord has shared with us, then He promises to share even more.  
Jesus said – *Whoever can be trusted with very little can also be trusted with much.*

This is the path to deeper insights, greater intimacy and living the abundant life God created us to live. This is the way we can walk in the good works God has already planned for us to do.

If we want to be rewarded with God’s greatest reward, then we have to practice the two things that He promises to bless.  
We must –  

- **OBEY** and **SHARE**  
- **DO** and **TEACH**  
- **PRACTICE** and **PASS ON**

Jesus said, “You will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you. And you will be my witnesses, telling people about me everywhere – in Jerusalem, throughout Judea, in Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.” – everything that God tells us to do.

If we want others to receive God’s greatest reward, then we have to show them how to do the same thing, too. This is a major part of being a disciple and a major part of making disciples.

We are **FOLLOWERS** and **LEADERS**  
We are **LEARNERS** and **TEACHERS**  
We are **BLESSED** and we are a **BLESSING**

God doesn’t want us to wait until we know everything before we start obeying and sharing. That day will never come.  
God doesn’t expect us to be fully mature before we start multiplying. He wants us to multiply right away.

God wants us to obey what we already know and to share what we’ve already heard.  
And then He wants us to teach others to do the same. After all – that’s obeying and sharing what He’s already told us to do.  
This is the path to maturity and growth.

---

## DISCUSS (10 min)

- What are some differences you see between God’s Spiritual Economy and our earthly way of getting things done?

---

## DISCUSS (10 min)

- What comes to mind when you hear God’s command to be His “witness” and to tell His story?  
- Why do you think Jesus chose ordinary people instead of some other way to share His good news?  
- What would it take for you to feel more comfortable sharing God’s story?

---

## The Gospel

There’s no one “best way” to tell God’s story (also called the gospel), because the best way will depend on who you’re sharing with. The best way will depend on who you’re sharing with and their view of the world and their life experiences.

Every disciple should learn to tell God’s story in a way that’s true to scripture and connects with the audience they’re sharing with.

Review the following two presentations and choose one to practice.

---

## READ (5 min)

### Presentation 1

In this session, we’ll learn how to share GOD’S STORY – The Gospel – from Creation to Judgement, from the beginning of humankind to the end of this age. There are many ways to share God’s story.

The best way will depend on the person you’re sharing with and their view of the world and their life experiences.  
God uses hearts willing to share to work on hearts willing to hear.  
It’s His work. He just invites us to join in.

One way to share God’s Story is by explaining what’s happened from God’s Creation to His Judgement at the end of this age. When we tell God’s story in this way, we can make it long or short, detailed or just broad strokes but always connected to the culture of the one who hears. To help tell His Story across different cultures and world views, you can also use hand motions that make it easier to learn and teach.

**Here is God’s Story of Good News**

- In the beginning, God made the whole world and everything in it.  
  He created the FIRST MAN and the FIRST WOMAN. He placed them in a beautiful garden.  
  He made them PART OF HIS FAMILY and had a CLOSE RELATIONSHIP with them.  
  He created them to LIVE FOREVER. There was no such thing as death.  
  Even in this perfect place, man rebelled against God and brought SIN and SUFFERING into the world.  
  God BANISHED man from the garden. The relationship between man and God was BROKEN. Now man would have to face DEATH.

- Over many hundreds of years, God kept sending MESSENGERS into the world. They reminded man of his sin but also told him of God’s FAITHFULNESS and PROMISE to send a SAVIOR into the world.

- The Savior would RESTORE the close relationship between God and Man.  
  The Savior would RESCUE man from death.  
  The Savior would give ETERNAL LIFE and be with man forever.

- God loves us so much that when the time was right, He sent His Son into the world to be that SAVIOR.  
  Jesus was God’s Son. He was born into the world through a virgin.  
  He lived a perfect life. He never sinned. Jesus taught people about God.  
  He performed many miracles showing His great power.  
  He cast out many demons. He healed many people. He made the blind see.  
  He made the deaf hear. He made the lame walk. Jesus even raised the dead.

- Many religious leaders were THREATENED and JEALOUS of Jesus. They wanted Him killed.

- Since He never sinned, Jesus did not have to die. But He CHOSE to die as a SACRIFICE for all of us.  
  His painful death covered up the sins of mankind.

- After this, Jesus was buried in a tomb. God saw the SACRIFICE Jesus made and accepted it.  
  God showed His acceptance by raising Jesus from the dead on the third day.

- God said that if we BELIEVE and RECEIVE Jesus’ sacrifice for our sins – If we TURN AWAY from our sins and FOLLOW Jesus, God CLEANS US from all sin and WELCOMES us back into His family.

- God sends the HOLY SPIRIT to live inside us and make us able to follow Jesus.  
  We are BAPTIZED in water to show and seal this restored relationship. As a symbol of death we are buried beneath the water. As a symbol of new life we are raised out of the water to follow Jesus.

- When Jesus rose from the dead, He spent 40 days on earth.  
  Jesus taught His followers to go everywhere and tell the good news of His salvation to everyone around the world.  
  Jesus said – Go and MAKE DISCIPLES of all nations, BAPTIZING them in the name of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit; and TEACHING them to obey all I have commanded. I will be with you always – even to the end of this age.

- Jesus was then TAKEN UP before their eyes into heaven. One day, Jesus will COME AGAIN in the same way He left.  
  He will PUNISH FOREVER those who did not love and obey Him.  
  He will RECEIVE and REWARD FOREVER those who did love and obey Him.  
  We will LIVE FOREVER with Him in a New Heaven and on a New Earth.

- I BELIEVED and RECEIVED the sacrifice Jesus made for my sins. He has made me clean and restored me as part of God’s family.  
  He loves me, and I love Him and will live with Him forever in His kingdom.

- God loves you and wants you to receive this gift, as well. Would you like to do that right now?

### Presentation 2

Welcome back to Zume Training.

In this session, we’ll learn how to share God’s story, the Gospel, by using a tool called Three Circles.

There are many ways to share God’s story. The best way will depend on the person you’re sharing with, and their view of the world and their life experiences.

God uses hearts willing to share to work on hearts willing to hear.  
It’s His work; He just invites us to join in.

One way to share God’s story is by sharing a simple drawing that we call Three Circles.

All of us live in a very broken world. We see and hear stories of suffering, death, war, disease, addictions. It’s everywhere. But this is not God’s original design. God’s perfect design is a world full of love, joy, unity, and peace.

The way we took ourselves out of God’s perfect design and came into brokenness is through something the Bible calls sin.  
Sin is turning away from God’s way and pursuing our own way. Sin separates us from God.  
Sin throws us into brokenness. Sin leads us to spiritual death.

People want out of brokenness. We try all kinds of different things to get out.  
Some of us try drugs and alcohol. Some of us try to get out through a good job or by making a lot of money.  
Some of us think a relationship will get them out. Some even try religion. We think good behavior or helping others will set us free.

None of these things ever actually fix the problem of brokenness.  
Even when we feel like we get away for a moment, we’re snapped right back to where we started.

Here’s a difficult truth: If we’re still there, still in brokenness when this life ends, then the Bible says we’re permanently separated from God, forever.  
The Bible calls that place Hell.

But God doesn’t want us to stay in brokenness. The Bible says God loved us so much that He sent His own Son to make a way out for us.

Jesus came to Earth to erase our sin and take us away from brokenness.  
But how? How could Jesus do all this?

Jesus lived a perfect life. Jesus was the only person who never sinned.  
He was the only person who stayed in God’s perfect design. Then Jesus gave up His perfect life and took our place.

He died on a cross to pay the price for our sin.  
So Jesus, God’s Son, canceled our sin with His death.

Three days after Jesus died and was buried, He rose from the dead.  
Because of His great sacrifice, God made Jesus the king of everything in Heaven and everything on Earth.

King Jesus made a way out of brokenness for us. God said that if we turn from our sin and believe that Jesus died for us, and are baptized in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, then God raises us, just like Jesus, to walk in a new kind of life as part of God’s family forever.

We then model this new life in the broken world, and await Jesus’ return when He will make a new Heaven and new Earth where we can be with Him forever in perfect wholeness.

God wants us to grow in our relationship with Him. God wants us restored back into His original perfect design.

As part of God’s family, Jesus gives us a mission, a reason for living, and a way to live the best possible life.

Jesus’ mission for us is to go. Jesus sends us, just like His Father, God, sent Him, back into brokenness to help others break free and become part of God’s forever family too.

In this Three Circles world, there are only two kinds of people:  

1. People who are a part of God’s perfect design, living out God’s rescue mission, helping reconnect God to His forever family.  
2. People who are still in brokenness, trying everything to break free, hoping that someone will save them.

Do you know where you are now? Do you know where you want to be?

There are many ways to share God’s story. The important thing is to share.  
God uses hearts willing to share to work on hearts willing to hear. It’s His work; He just invites us to join in.

## ACTIVITY (45 min)

**Share the Gospel**

1. Choose one of the two presentations you watched.  
2. Break into groups of two or three people.  
3. Take turns telling the Gospel to each other.

## READ (5 min)

### Baptism

Jesus said – “go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit…”

Baptism – or “Baptizo” in the original language – means a drenching or submerging – like when you dye a cloth and it soaks in the color and comes out transformed.

Baptism is a picture of our new life, soaked in the image of Jesus, transformed in obedience to God. It is a picture of our death to sin, just as Jesus died for our sins; a burial of our old way of life, just as Jesus was buried; a rebirth to a new life in Christ, just as Jesus was resurrected and lives today.

If you have never baptized someone before, it may seem intimidating, but it shouldn’t be. Here are some simple steps.

1. Find some standing water, deep enough to allow the new disciple to be submerged.  
   This could be a pond, river, lake or ocean. It could be a bathtub or another way to gather water.
2. Let the disciple hold one of your hands with theirs and support their back with the other.
3. Ask two questions like these to make sure they understand their decision.  
   “Have you received Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior?”  
   “Will you obey and serve Him as your King for the rest of your life?”
4. If they answer “Yes,” to both, then say something like this:  
   “Because you’ve professed your faith in the Lord Jesus, I now baptize you in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.”
5. Help them lower into the water, submerge completely and raise them back up.

You’ve baptized a new follower of Jesus – a new citizen of heaven – a new child of the Living God. It’s time to celebrate!

Baptism – the first sacrament Jesus gave His followers and a foundation of the Zúme Toolkit.

---

## DISCUSS (10 min)

- Have you ever baptized someone?  
- Would you even consider it?  
- If the Great Commission is for every follower of Jesus, does that mean every follower is allowed to baptize others? Why or why not?

**IMPORTANT REMINDER – Have you been baptized?**  
If not, then we encourage you to plan this before even one more session of this training. Invite your group to be a part of this important day when you celebrate saying “yes” to Jesus.

---

## NEXT STEP

**IMPORTANT REMINDER – Your group will be celebrating the Lord’s Supper next session. Be sure to remember the supplies (bread and wine / juice).**

## Overview (1 min)

In this session, we will hear and discuss these concepts:

- Vision Casting the Greatest Blessing  
- Duckling Discipleship  
- Eyes to See Where the Kingdom Isn’t  

And we will add these tools to our toolkit:

- Three‑Minute Testimony  
- The Lord’s Supper  

## Read (5 min)

### Three‑Minute Testimony

Jesus told His followers – “You are witnesses of these things.” As followers of Jesus, we are “witnesses,” too – “testifying” about the impact Jesus has had on our lives. Your story of your relationship with God is called your testimony. Everybody has a story. This is a chance to practice yours.

Choose one or two followers to practice with and then pick 5 names from your List of 100. Make sure you choose people in the category “non‑Christian” or “unknown spiritual status.” Practice your testimony – your story of Jesus – by having your practice partners pretend to be 1 of the 5 people you chose from your list. Practice shaping your story to make it specific for each of the 5. You should be able to share a short version of your story in about three minutes.

There are endless ways to shape your story, but here are some ways that we’ve seen work well with others:  

- **You can share a simple statement about why you chose to follow Jesus.** This works well for a brand new believer.  
- **You can share your “before” and “after” story** – what your life was like before you knew Jesus and what your life is now. Simple and powerful.  
- **You can share your “with” and “without” story** – what your life is like “with Jesus” and what it would be like “without Him.” This version of your story works well if you came to faith at a young age.  

When sharing your story, it’s helpful to think of it as part of a three‑part process:

1. **Their story** – Ask the person you are talking with to share about their spiritual journey.  
2. **Your story** – Then share your testimony shaped around their experience.  
3. **God’s story** – Finally share God’s story in a way that connects with their worldview, values and priorities.  

And if you’re worried about how to get started – keep it simple. Just share a statement of why you decided to follow Jesus. God can use your story to change lives, but remember – you’re the one who gets to tell it.

Your Three‑Minute Testimony is another simple tool in the Zúme Toolkit.

## Activity (30 min)

### Practice sharing your testimony

- Work on writing out your story and keeping it to only three minutes. (10 min)  
- Break into groups of two to three and practice sharing. (20 min)

#### Three Basic Kinds of Testimonies

There are endless ways to shape your story, but here are some ways that we’ve seen work well:

- **A Simple Statement** – You can share a simple statement about why you chose to follow Jesus. This works well for a brand new believer.  
- **Before and After** – You can share your “before” and “after” story – what your life was like before you knew Jesus and what your life is now. Simple and powerful.  
- **With and Without** – You can share your “with” and “without” story – what your life is like “with Jesus” and what it would be like “without Him.” This version of your story works well if you came to faith at a young age.  

#### Three Parts to Sharing Your Testimony

When sharing your story, it’s helpful to think of it as part of a three‑part process:

1. **Their Story** – Ask the person you are talking with to share about their spiritual journey.  
2. **Your Story** – Then share your testimony shaped around their experience.  
3. **God’s Story** – Finally share God’s story in a way that connects with their worldview, values and priorities.  

Your testimony doesn’t have to be lengthy or share too many details to be impactful. In fact, keeping your story to around 3‑minutes will leave time for questions and deeper conversation. If you’re worried about how to get started – keep it simple. God can use your story to change lives, but remember – you’re the one who gets to tell it.

### Great – Greater – Greatest Blessings

In this session, we’ll talk about God’s **GREAT**, **GREATER** and **GREATEST BLESSINGS** and how you can share them with others. When someone chooses to follow Jesus, how do you help them move down the right path? How do you help them become a producer in God’s kingdom and not just another consumer? How do you help them receive all the blessings that God is willing to give?

I start by telling them this…

- It is a blessing to follow Jesus.  
- It is a great blessing to lead others to follow Jesus.  
- It is a greater blessing to start a new spiritual family.  
- It is the greatest blessing to equip others to start new spiritual families.

You have chosen to follow Jesus and so God has blessed you. I want you to have God’s great blessing, greater blessing and greatest blessing, too. Can I show you how?

If they want to know more, I ask them to make a list of 100 people they already know. Then I ask them to choose five people from that list – five people who do not know Jesus – five people they want to share with right away.

It is a blessing to follow Jesus. Who else do you want to share this blessing with?  
I teach them to share their **TESTIMONY** – the story of what God is doing in their life. I teach them to share the **GOSPEL** – the story of what God is doing in the world. I teach them how to share about God’s great, greater and greatest blessings.

I have them practice these things one time for each of the five people they’ve chosen to share with. First their story. Then God’s story. Then God’s blessings. Each time, I pretend to be one of the five people from their list. Each time, they share their story. They share God’s story. They invite me to become a follower of Jesus, too. I teach about God’s great, greater and greatest blessing. Each time, I ask them questions or make comments that I think that person might make. After we’ve practiced, I ask to meet them again – just two days later if possible – to see how this sharing is going.

I want to give them enough time to meet with the five from their list, but I don’t want to give so much time that they put it off or forget.  
I always ask for a phone number or email address or another way to keep in touch. I pray with them that God will give the right words just as they’ve shared with me.

Two days later, we meet again and talk about how the sharing is going. If they haven’t shared, I offer to practice with them more. I offer to go with them right then to any of the five who might be available. I do everything I can to help them begin sharing. But I won’t talk about new things. I want to give them the best opportunity to be faithful with what they’ve already learned.

If they refuse or make excuses, I ask God if this is really “good soil” that will be fruitful for His kingdom or if there is somewhere else where I should be investing.  

If they shared – we celebrate!  
Even if none on their list believed, I’m excited that they **HEARD**, **OBEYED** and **SHARED**. That’s being faithful. And since they’ve been faithful with a little, I’m glad to share more.

I share about **BAPTISM** and give them another tool they can use like ___ or ___.

Ask them to choose some other people from their list of 100 – people who don’t know or don’t follow Jesus.  
And then I practice with them – just like before – with their story, with God’s story and with the blessings. And we pray.  

Now if they shared AND someone on their list believed, we really **CELEBRATE!**  
God’s family is getting bigger! I always ask if they shared about the great, greater and greatest blessing, because this is what keeps God’s family growing.

If they didn’t share about God’s blessings, we go over it again – the blessings, how a new follower of Jesus can make a list, how they can share their story, share God’s story and share the blessings – all so that new follower of Jesus can learn to share, too.

After we’ve practiced, I send them back to that new believer so they can continue sharing. But what about those who have shared AND someone on their list believed AND they shared the blessings?  
When that happens I am **OVERJOYED**.

This person is what God’s word calls “good soil” – someone who may grow God’s family in ways that are greater than I’ve ever seen! Whenever I find someone like this, I make plans to meet with them often. I invest heavily in their spiritual development.

I share new lessons like **BAPTISM** and how to start a **THREE‑THIRDS GROUP**. Now they can begin to grow a spiritual family – starting with those same new followers of Jesus.

Since they are so faithful, I’m excited to share as much as I can and see what God does next. Always a step at a time. Always giving them a chance to **LEARN, OBEY and SHARE** what they know.

I also pray for this person – as often as I can – thanking God for allowing me to share and learn with them and always asking Him to give them His **GREATEST BLESSING**.

## Discuss (10 min)

- Is this the pattern you were taught when you first began to follow Jesus? If not, what was different?  
- After you came to faith, how long was it before you began to disciple others?  
- What do you think would happen if new followers started sharing and discipling others, immediately?

## Read (5 min)

### Duckling Discipleship

Welcome back to Zúme Training. In this session, we’ll learn how a brood of ducklings just learning to waddle can help us understand two of the most important principles of disciple‑making.

Have you ever seen a group of ducklings out for a walk?  
No matter where you are in the world, it always looks the same. A Mother Duck leads and her ducklings follow – one by one – all in a row. The Mother Duck leads. The little ducks follow.

But if you look even closer, you’ll see something else is happening, too. Each little duckling is actually playing two roles – at exactly the same time.

- **Each little duckling is a FOLLOWER**, because it’s following the Mother Duck or another duckling that’s walking right in front of it.  
- **And, at exactly the same time – Each little duckling is a LEADER**, because it’s leading the duckling (or ducklings) that’s walking right behind it.

So is the duckling a FOLLOWER or a LEADER? It’s both. And that’s why ducks “out for a walk” have everything to do with making disciples.

God wants His family to grow far – and so He expects every follower to be a leader, every believer to be a sharer, and every disciple to be a disciple‑maker – at exactly the same time.

One of the traps we fall into, as disciples and disciple‑makers, is the false belief that we have to know everything, or even just a lot of things, before we share anything. But that’s not how discipleship works.

Disciples are like ducklings. To be a leader, they don’t have to know everything. They just have to be one step ahead. God wants His family to grow in faithfulness – and so He expects every leader to be a follower, every sharer to be a believer, and every disciple‑maker to be a disciple – at exactly the same time, too.

Another trap we fall into, as disciples and disciple‑makers, is the false belief that someone, somewhere knows everything and if we just find and follow them, then we’re set. But that’s not how discipleship works, either.

In God’s Kingdom, there’s only one “Mother Duck” that all of us follow – and that’s Jesus Christ. No missionary. No pastor. No seminary professor. Only Jesus deserves the full measure of our faith.

The rest of us are “in process.” There will always be someone closer to Jesus that we can follow. And there will always be someone further away that we can lead. But no matter our position, our eyes – and our hearts – should always be fully fixed on Jesus. In the Bible, Paul, who wrote much of the New Testament and started many of the first churches, didn’t just write – “Follow me.” He wrote, “Follow me, as I follow Christ.” Paul knew what ducklings everywhere know and what every disciple should know, too – every leader in God’s Kingdom has to be a follower – and all of us follow Jesus.

In the Bible, Paul also wrote: “What you have heard from me… share with faithful men, who will be able to teach others, too.”  
Paul knew what ducklings everywhere know and what every disciple should know, too. Every follower in God’s Kingdom has to be a leader – and all of us should lead like Jesus, laying down our lives for others.

If you want to see God’s family grow far and grow in faithfulness, then think of disciple‑making like ducklings – become a follower and a leader at exactly the same time.

## Discuss (10 min)

- What is one area of discipleship (reading/understanding the Bible, praying, sharing God’s story, etc.) that you want to learn more about? Who is someone that could help you learn?  
- What is one area of discipleship that you feel you could share with others? Who is someone that you could share with?

### Eyes to See Where the Kingdom Isn’t

In this session, we’ll learn how disciples multiply far and fast when they start to see where God’s Kingdom isn’t.

As humans, we think about, focus on and work for things that we can see. We call it reality – the way things are. The way they’re. But the kingdom grows more quickly when we focus on things we can’t see – things that aren’t there. Or things that aren’t there, yet.

There are places all around us where God’s will is not being done on earth as it is in heaven – giant gaps where brokenness, pain, persecution, suffering and even death are a part of normal, everyday life.

Every disciple – every follower of Jesus – needs to be able to see not just where God’s Kingdom is, but where God’s kingdom isn’t. Kingdom work is about entering into those gaps and into those dark places and working to close the chasms and bring light and life during our time here on earth.

We can see where God’s Kingdom isn’t in two ways – through people we already know and through people we haven’t yet met.

The first way is **through people we already know** – our ONGOING RELATIONSHIPS of friends and family, coworkers, classmates, neighbors and more. This is the way God’s Story travels FASTEST. We love and care about these people because we know them already. It’s natural.

Jesus told a story of a selfish rich man – arrogant in life and now being punished in hell. The rich man begged – “send Lazarus to my father’s home. Let him warn my five brothers, so they won’t come to this horrible place.”

Jesus showed us how even the selfish and suffering have some love and concern for those close to them.

The people we know are placed in our lives because God loves us and wants us to love them. We need to be good stewards of those relationships with love, patience and persistence. Disciples multiply when they’re concerned for the people God’s placed around them and they have a plan to do something about it.

You can help increase their care and build a simple plan to multiply in just a few steps. Here’s how – have them write a list of 100 people they already know. Have them break that list into three categories.

- Those who follow Jesus.  
- Those who don’t follow Jesus.  
- Those who they’re not sure whether they follow or not.

For the followers – disciples can equip and encourage them to be more fruitful and faithful.  
For the non‑followers – disciples can learn how to share and introduce them to a loving God.  
For those who they’re not sure – disciples can learn to invest their time and learn more.

There’s also a way we see where God’s Kingdom isn’t through people we haven’t met. These are people OUTSIDE OUR RELATIONSHIPS – people we don’t know, neighbors we’ve never said more than “hello” to, businessmen and women we pass on the street, strangers in every village, town or city we’ve never even visited, yet.

Jesus said – make disciples of all nations. Jesus said – you will tell everyone about me in Jerusalem, in all Judea, in Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.

Sharing with people we know is the way God’s Story travels FASTEST. Sharing with people we don’t know yet is the way God’s Story travels FARTHEST.

If we love and care about those we don’t know, that’s not natural. It’s supernatural and evidence of the Holy Spirit at work in our lives. God’s favorites are the least, the last and the lost. These are the ones He pours out His heart to over and over again.

If we want to be like God, then these are the ones we have to invest our lives in. God commands us to go. And part of going is to go not just to those who are close by but also to those who live in the spiritually darkest corners of the world – people who sometimes have never even heard the name, Jesus.

God’s Word says – God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble. As followers of Jesus we must give grace as He gives it – to the humble, to the desperate and to the lost. Disciples multiply when they’re concerned for the people God’s placed in their lives. Disciples multiply even more when they’re concerned for the people God’s placed nowhere near them. But even then they still need a plan.

You can help increase a disciple’s care for others and build a simple plan to multiply by training them to look for the people God’s already prepared to hear. Jesus said – As soon as you enter a home, say, “God bless this home with peace.” If the people living there are peace‑loving, your prayer for peace will bless them. But if they are not peace‑loving, your prayer will return to you.

We call someone who God has already prepared to hear a PERSON OF PEACE – someone responsive to God’s message and faithful in OBEYING and SHARING with others. In a place where we know very few, instead of sharing with our friends, families, co‑workers, classmates and neighbors, we train a person of peace how to reach theirs.

But the best results always come when we focus on the faithful. Remember faithfulness is demonstrated by OBEYING what God tells us and SHARING it with others. Faithful people don’t have hard hearts that reject God’s Word. Faithful people don’t fall away when they’re persecuted or when times get hard. Faithful people aren’t distracted by the worries of this world or riches that don’t last. Faithful people are like the demon‑possessed man in the Gerasenes who obeyed and shared what Jesus showed him. One faithful man who obeyed and shared produced many, many people who wanted to know Jesus more.

Opening our eyes to see where the Kingdom isn’t and reaching out through people we know and people we don’t know yet is how disciples multiply and God’s Kingdom grows far and fast.

## Discuss (10 min)

- Who are you more comfortable sharing with – people you already know or people you haven’t met, yet?  
- Why do you think that is?  
- How could you get better at sharing with people you’re less comfortable with?

### The Lord’s Supper

Jesus said – “I am the living bread that came down from heaven. Whoever eats this bread will live forever. This bread is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.”  

Holy Communion or “The Lord’s Supper” is a way to celebrate our intimate connection and ongoing relationship with Jesus.

Here’s a simple way to celebrate —

When you gather as followers of Jesus, spend time in quiet meditation, silently considering and confessing your sins. Have someone read this passage from scripture – “For I received from the Lord that which I also delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus in the night in which He was betrayed took bread; and when He had given thanks, He broke it and said, “This is My body, which is for you; do this in remembrance of Me.” (1 Corinthians 11:23‑24)

Pass out bread you have set aside for your group and eat.

Continue the reading – “In the same way, He took the cup also after supper, saying, ‘This cup is the new covenant in My blood; do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of Me.’” (1 Corinthians 11:25)

Share the juice or wine you have set aside for your group and drink.

Finish the reading – “For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord’s death until He comes.” (1 Corinthians 11:26)

You have shared in The Lord’s Supper.

Celebrate in prayer or singing – you are His and He is yours!

Spend the next 10 minutes celebrating the Lord’s Supper with your group.

When you gather as followers of Jesus:

1. Spend time in quiet meditation, silently considering and confessing your sins.  
2. When you are ready, have someone read this passage from scripture – For I received from the Lord that which I also delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus in the night in which He was betrayed took bread; and when he had given thanks, he broke it and said, “This is My body….” (1 Corinthians 11:23‑24)  
3. Pass out bread you have set aside for your group, and eat.  
4. Continue the reading – In the same way, He took the cup also after supper, saying, “This cup is the new covenant in My blood; do this, as….” (1 Corinthians 11:25)  
5. Share the juice or wine you have set aside for your group, and drink.  
6. Finish the reading: For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord’s death until He comes. (1 Corinthians 11:26)  
7. Celebrate in prayer or singing. You have shared in the Lord’s Supper. You are His, and He is yours!

## OVERVIEW (1 min)

In this session, we will hear and discuss this concept: **Person of Peace**  
And we will add these tools to our toolkit:

- B.L.E.S.S. Prayer
- Prayer Walking

---

## READ (5 min) – Prayer Walking

> **Prayer Walking**  
> God’s Word says that we should “petition, pray, intercede and give thanksgiving for all people, for kings and all those in authority – that we may live peaceful and quiet lives in all godliness and holiness. This is good, and pleases God our Savior, who wants all people to be saved and to come to a knowledge of the truth.”  

Prayer Walking is a simple way to obey God’s command to pray for others. It’s just what it sounds like—praying to God while walking around.  
Instead of closing our eyes and bowing our heads, we keep our eyes open to the needs we see around us and bow our hearts to ask humbly for God to intervene.  

- **You can prayer walk** in small groups of two or three, or you can pray by yourself.  
  - If you go in a group—try having everyone pray out loud, a conversation with God about what everyone is seeing and the needs that God brings to their hearts.  
  - If you go by yourself—pray silently or out loud if you pray with someone you meet along the way.

### How to know what to pray for during your prayer walk

| Source | What it looks like |
|--------|--------------------|
| **Observation** | What do you see? If you see a child’s toy in a yard, you might be prompted to pray for the neighborhood’s children, families or schools. |
| **Research** | What do you know? If you’ve read up about the neighborhood, you might know something about the people who live there or if the area suffers from crime or injustice. Pray about these things and ask God to act. |
| **Revelation** | The Holy Spirit may nudge your heart or bring an idea to mind for a particular need or area of prayer. Listen—and pray! |
| **Scripture** | You may have read part of God’s Word in preparation for your walk or as you walk, the Holy Spirit may bring a Scripture to mind. Pray about that passage and how it might impact the people in that area. |

### Five areas of influence to focus on during your prayer walk

1. **Government** – Look for and pray over government centers such as courthouses, commission buildings or law‑enforcement offices. Pray for the area’s protection, for justice and for godly wisdom for its leaders.
2. **Business & Commerce** – Look for and pray over commercial centers such as financial districts or shopping areas. Pray for righteous investments, good stewardship of resources, economic justice and opportunity, and for generous and godly givers who put people before profits.
3. **Education** – Look for and pray over educational centers such as schools, administration buildings, vocational training centers, community colleges and universities. Pray for righteous educators to teach God’s truth and protect the minds of their students; pray that God would intervene in every effort to promote lies or confusion. Pray that these places would send out wise citizens who have a heart to serve and lead.
4. **Communication** – Look for and pray over communication centers such as radio stations, TV stations and newspaper publishers. Pray that God’s story and the testimony of His followers be spread throughout the city and around the world. Pray that His message is delivered through His medium to His multitudes and that God’s people everywhere will see God’s work.
5. **Spirituality** – Look for and pray over spiritual centers such as church buildings, mosques or temples. Pray that every spiritual seeker would find peace and comfort in Jesus and not be distracted or confused by any false religion.

### How to pray for people you meet during your prayer walk

- **Be alert** for opportunities and listen for promptings by God’s Spirit to pray for individuals and groups you meet along the way.  
- You can say, “We’re praying for this community— is there anything in particular we can pray for you about?” or “I’m praying for this area. Do you know anything in particular we should pray for?”  
- After listening to their response, ask about their own needs. If they share, pray for them right away.  
- If the Lord leads, you may pray about other needs as well.

### Using the word **BLESS** to remember 5 different ways you can pray

| BLESS | What it covers |
|-------|----------------|
| **Body** | Health |
| **Labor** | Job and finances |
| **Emotional** | Morale |
| **Social** | Relationships |
| **Spiritual** | Knowing and loving God more |

- In most cases, people are grateful you care enough to pray.  
- If the person is not a Christian, your prayer may open the door to a spiritual conversation and an opportunity to share your story and God’s story. You can invite them to be a part of a Bible study or even host one in their home.  
- If the person is a Christian you can invite them to join your prayer walk or train them how they can prayer‑walk and use simple steps like praying for areas of influence or the BLESS prayer to grow God’s family even more.

## READ (5 min) – Person of Peace

Welcome back to Zúme Training. In an earlier session you were introduced to the idea of a **Person of Peace**. In this session we’ll go into more detail about who that person might be and how to know when you’ve found one.

A Person of Peace can help rapidly reproduce disciple‑making even in a place where followers of Jesus are few and far between.

When Jesus sent out His disciples to new territory to make disciples, He gave them a simple but strategic command:

> “Carry no money belt, no bag, no shoes; greet no one on the way. Whatever house you enter, first say, ‘Peace be to this house.’ If a man of peace is there, your peace will rest on him; but if not, it will return to you. Stay in that same house, eating and drinking what they give you; for the laborer is worthy of his wages. Do not keep moving from house to house.”

But what does all that mean?

When we think of making disciples, our first thought might be – “We better get our finances in order, pick an obvious target, and have a clear plan of action.” If Jesus said – “Go,” we better “go” and keep on going! Tell Everyone! Everywhere!! All the time!!!

But Jesus, in His instructions, seemed a lot less worried about finances and fervor, and a lot more concerned about focus. Jesus wanted His disciples looking for – and investing in – a Person of Peace.

When you want to make disciples in a place where not many – or maybe even any – exist, then looking for a Person of Peace might be the most important thing you do.

### A Person of Peace is

1. **Someone who is OPEN** to hearing your story, God’s story and the Good News of Jesus.  
2. **Someone who is HOSPITABLE** and welcomes you into their home or workplace or to join events with family and friends.  
3. **Someone who KNOWS OTHERS** (or is KNOWN BY OTHERS) and who is excited to draw together a small group or even a crowd.  
4. **Someone who is FAITHFUL** and shares what they learn with others – even after you’re gone.

In the Bible, we learn of Jesus and His followers meeting Persons of Peace that are a little – unexpected. In the region of the Gadarenes, Jesus met a demon‑possessed man who lived isolated and in chains. We would never think of Him as a Person of Peace, but He was OPEN to hear from Jesus. He was HOSPITABLE and welcomed Jesus where He lived. He was WELL‑KNOWN and could easily draw a crowd – even if only for his outrageous behavior.

Jesus found that he was FAITHFUL and SHARED what Jesus meant to him with his family, his community and his whole country. In fact, when Jesus came back to that area, a great crowd gathered, excited to see the man they had heard so much about.

In Samaria, Jesus met a woman at a well. She was OPEN to Jesus, willing to be HOSPITABLE and answer His request for a drink. We learn she had five husbands and was living with still another man, and so in a small town, she was sure to be KNOWN BY OTHERS. And after Jesus spoke to her, she was FAITHFUL and SHARED – so much and so quickly that the entire town asked Jesus to stay and share with them, too. And He did.

So, if a Person of Peace can live almost anywhere, do almost anything, and be almost anyone we know or meet – how do we find one?

### Three simple ways

1. **ASK** for recommendations from people in the community – “Who’s someone that’s trusted here? Is there someone in this place who thinks of others before themselves?” If you hear the same name again and again – try to meet them, share spiritual ideas, and see if they’re open to hear and share.  
2. **OFFER** to pray for someone while Prayer Walking, or at work, or at the game – wherever there’s an opportunity – and then turn that prayer into a spiritual conversation.  
3. **INTRODUCE** spiritual ideas into every conversation to see if God is working in a person’s life. If they are open and willing, then we ask if they would be willing to gather a group to discuss even more.

> **ASK** for recommendations, **OFFER** to pray, **INTRODUCE** spiritual ideas.  
> These are all ways we can begin the process of finding a Person of Peace.

And no matter how we find them, remember Jesus said a Person of Peace is someone we should be spending most of our disciple‑making time with.

It’s easy to think that the most “fair” use of our time is to give a little bit of ourselves to everyone, equally. But Jesus said – and showed – that He doesn’t want us to be shallow with everyone but to give deeply to a few.

Jesus often attracted crowds, but the Bible tells us again and again that Jesus would draw away from those crowds to spend most of His time with just twelve of His closest followers.

There were a number of times where Jesus would invest even more time with a smaller group of just three.

If Jesus, who had much more power, much more energy, much more authority, discipline, wisdom, knowledge, understanding and compassion chose to spend His time investing deeply in just a few and told His own disciples to do the same, doesn’t it make sense that we should follow and share His perfect pattern?

A Person of Peace.  
They’re not easy to find – maybe one in a thousand. But like a hidden treasure that’s worth the search, their value in growing God’s family can’t be measured.

## DISCUSS (10 min)

- **Can someone who has a “bad reputation”** (like the Samaritan woman or the demon‑possessed man in the Gadarenes) really be a Person of Peace? Why or why not?  
- **What is a community or segment of society near you that seems to have little (or no) Kingdom presence?**  
- **How could a Person of Peace (someone who is OPEN, HOSPITABLE, KNOWS OTHERS and SHARES) accelerate the spread of the Gospel in that community?**

---

## ACTIVITY (10 min) – Practice the B.L.E.S.S. Prayer

Break into groups of two or three and practice praying the five areas of the B.L.E.S.S. Prayer over each other.

### The BLESS prayer pattern

> **Body** – health  
> **Labor** – job and finances  
> **Emotional** – morale  
> **Social** – relationships  
> **Spiritual** – knowing and loving God more  

---

## ACTIVITY (60–90 min) – Prayer Walking

Break into groups of two or three and go out into the community to practice Prayer Walking.

- Choosing a location can be as simple as walking outside from where you are now, or you could plan to go to a specific destination.  
- Go as God leads, and plan on spending 60–90 minutes on this activity.  
- This session ends with the prayer walking activity.

### Four sources that can guide your prayer

1. **Observation** – What do you see?  
2. **Research** – What do you know?  
3. **Revelation** – The Holy Spirit may nudge your heart or bring an idea to mind for a particular need or area of prayer.  
4. **Scripture** – You may have read part of God’s Word in preparation for your walk or as you walk; the Holy Spirit may bring a Scripture to mind.

### Five areas of influence on which to focus prayer

1. **Government** – Look for and pray over government centers such as courthouses, commission buildings or law‑enforcement offices. Pray for the area’s protection, for justice and for godly wisdom for its leaders.  
2. **Business & Commerce** – Look for and pray over commercial centers such as financial districts or shopping areas. Pray for righteous investments, good stewardship of resources, economic justice and opportunity, and for generous and godly givers who put people before profits.  
3. **Education** – Look for and pray over educational centers such as schools, administration buildings, vocational training centers, community colleges and universities. Pray for righteous educators to teach God’s truth and protect the minds of their students; pray that God would intervene in every effort to promote lies or confusion. Pray that these places would send out wise citizens who have a heart to serve and lead.  
4. **Communication** – Look for and pray over communication centers such as radio stations, TV stations and newspaper publishers. Pray that God’s story and the testimony of His followers be spread throughout the city and around the world. Pray that His message is delivered through His medium to His multitudes and that God’s people everywhere will see God’s work.  
5. **Spirituality** – Look for and pray over spiritual centers such as church buildings, mosques or temples. Pray that every spiritual seeker would find peace and comfort in Jesus and not be distracted or confused by any false religion.

## PRAY (5 min)

Before you go out on your Prayer Walking activity, be sure to pray with your group to end your time together.

- Thank God that He loves the lost, the last and the least – including us!  
- Ask Him to prepare your heart and the hearts of those you’ll meet during your walk to be open to His work.

### OVERVIEW  
**(1 min)**  
- In this session, we will hear and discuss this concept: **Faithfulness is Better than Knowledge**  
- And we will add this tool to our toolkit: **3/3 Group Meeting**  

---

## READ  
**(5 min)** – *Faithfulness*  

In this session, we’ll learn how **FAITHFULNESS** is a much better measure of spiritual maturity than knowledge and training.  

There are two ideas that have caused a number of problems in the church, today.

1. **Orthodoxy** – the idea that someone’s spiritual maturity is connected to how much they know about God’s Word.  
   - They act as if **RIGHT BELIEF** – or orthodoxy – is a good measure of someone’s faith.  
2. **Full training** – the idea that someone’s ability to lead requires a “full training” before they begin ministry.  
   - They act as if **COMPLETE KNOWLEDGE** is a good measure of someone’s ability to serve.  

### The problem with the first idea – relying on ORTHODOXY  
- Satan, himself, knows more scripture than any human.  
- GOD’S WORD says – “You believe that there is one God.”  
  - Good! Even the demons believe that— and shudder.  

### A better measure of someone’s spiritual maturity  
- **ORTHOPRAXY** – “right practice”.  
- We should be much more concerned with **FAITHFULNESS in obeying and sharing** than measuring maturity based only on what we know.  

### The problem with the second idea – that someone must be fully trained before they lead  
- No one is ever fully trained.  
- Jesus modeled sending out young leaders who still had many things to learn to do some of the most important work in the Kingdom.  
- GOD’S WORD says – Jesus called together his twelve apostles and gave them complete power over all demons and diseases. Then he sent them to tell about God’s kingdom and to heal the sick.  

These men were sent before Peter shared his belief that Jesus was Savior – something we’d consider a first step of faith.  
Even after being sent, Jesus rebuked Peter multiple times for mistakes and Peter would still later deny Jesus completely.  
Other followers argued over who was the greatest and what role each would play in God’s future Kingdom.  

They all still had a lot to learn but Jesus put them to work sharing what they already knew.  

**Faithfulness – more than knowledge – is something that can start as soon someone begins to follow Jesus.**  
**Faithfulness – more than training – is something that can be measured by what we do with what we’ve been given.**  

- If we **OBEY** and **SHARE** what we hear with others, we are faithful.  
- If we hear but we **REFUSE** to obey and share, we are unfaithful.  

As we multiply disciples, let’s make sure we’re measuring the right things.

---

## DISCUSS  
**(10 min)**  

Think about God’s commands that you already know. How “faithful” are you in terms of obeying and sharing those things?

---

## READ  
**(75 min)** – *3/3 Group Meeting*  

Welcome back to Zúme Training. In this session, we’ll learn how a **3/3 (pronounced “Three‑Thirds”) Group** is a method of meeting that helps followers of Jesus help one another follow Jesus more closely.  

Jesus said – “where two or three have gathered together in My name, I am there in their midst.” That’s a powerful promise, and one that every follower of Jesus should take advantage of. But when you come together as a group, how should you spend your time?  

A 3/3 Group is one that divides their time together into **three parts**, so that they can practice obeying some of the most important things that Jesus commands.

### How it works

| Part | Focus | Visual |
|------|-------|--------|
| **Look Back** | 1/3 of the group’s time is spent looking back at what’s happened since we’ve been together. | 1/3 |
| **Look Up** | 2/3 of the group’s time is spent looking up for God’s wisdom and direction through scripture, discussion and prayer. | 2/3 |
| **Look Forward** | 3/3 of the group’s time is spent looking forward to how we can each apply and obey what we’ve learned. | 3/3 |

In this session your group will be guided through a **short version** of a 3/3 group to help prepare you for a full version in real life.  

Remember the session on spiritual breathing? Breathe in, hear from God. Breathe out, obey what you hear and share it with others. That’s what a 3/3 group is all about.

This practice session should last a little over an hour, and it will move quickly. If you have a large group or one that likes deep discussions, you might want to ask one member of the group to help keep you on track with a watch or timer.  

In real life, these steps will move at a slower pace, but while you’re practicing be sure to keep going so you don’t run out of time. Don’t skip any steps – they’re all important!

Remember a 3/3 Group is not the same as a Bible Study – that’s on purpose! Treat this experience as an opportunity to learn a new way to meet and see what good God has planned for your time together.

---

### LOOKING BACK

We’ll spend the first third of our time looking back by caring for each other through giving thanks, sharing our struggles and praying for other members of our group. We’ll also check in to see if each person in the group has had the opportunity to obey and share what they learned the last time we were together.

#### Step One – “Giving Thanks”
Take some time to have each person share something they are thankful for.  
*Push pause on this video and do that right now… Are you still there? Really, we want you to hit pause, and have each person in your group share something you’re thankful to God for. We’ll be here when you get back.* (2 min)

#### Step Two – “Sharing your Struggles” and “Praying for One Another”
Now have each person in your group briefly share something they are struggling with. Have someone else pray for them about what they share.  
*Press pause, then share and pray.* (8 min)

#### Step Three – “Focusing the Group”
Every time you meet, you’ll want to take time and remember why you’re together – to love God, to love others, to share Jesus, and help others share Him too.  
There are lots of ways to focus the group on the mission, but for this practice session have someone read Matthew 22:37‑38 out loud to the group.  
*Press pause, then read.* (2 min)

#### Step Four – “Checking In”
This is the part that some groups want to skip, because it means asking questions that can sometimes be hard.  
Please don’t skip. Jesus loved His followers enough to ask hard questions. If we want to be like Jesus, we should love one another enough to do that, too.  

In this step, you’ll have each person in the group report on whether they obeyed what they heard. God asks them to do the last time you were together.  
In each Zúme session, we’ve modeled these commitments in our Looking Forward step where we ask you to Obey, Share, and Pray. We model accountability in our Looking Back step where we ask you to Check‑In on those same commitments.  

If you haven’t been spending a lot of time on these steps up to now in the training, this is a good time to start.  

Part of loving God is to obey what He tells us. Part of loving one another means helping someone obey what they hear from God. Love means taking someone’s commitments seriously – and showing them love graciously – all at the same time.  

*Press pause and have each person answer the following questions:*  
- How have you obeyed what you’ve learned so far?  
- Who have you trained in what you’ve learned?  
- Who have you shared your story or God’s story with since we’ve been together as a group?  

(12 min)

> **ZÚME COACHING TIP**  
> Sometimes in a group, one person might be the one who ends up talking most of the time. Don’t let this happen. Everyone in the group has value, so make sure everyone gets a chance to share. If others aren’t getting a chance to speak, gently remind whoever’s talking the most that each person should be heard.

---

### LOOKING UP

During the middle third of our time together, we invite God’s Holy Spirit to lead our group to better understand God’s Word.  
We’ll read a passage from the Bible out loud and then ask and answer some simple questions as a group to help explore and understand better God’s purposes and plans.

#### Step One – Invite God’s Holy Spirit to Lead  
Take a moment to pray. Talk with God simply and briefly. Ask His Holy Spirit to teach you from the passage you are about to read.  
*Press pause and pray.* (2 min)

#### Step Two – Read God’s Word and Ask Questions  
Have someone in the group read from the Bible. For this practice session, read Luke 18:9‑14.  
When you’ve finished reading, the group should answer these two questions:  

1. What did you like about this passage?  
2. What did you find challenging or hard to understand?  

If there are oral learners – people who don’t read well or prefer to learn by hearing – in your group, make sure you read through the passage at least twice.  

*Press pause, then read and answer the questions.* (10 min)

Now have someone else read the same passage a second time, and then have the group answer these two questions:  

1. What can we learn about people from this passage?  
2. What can we learn about God from this passage?  

Remember stick to the passage and keep it simple! (10 min)

> **ZÚME COACHING TIP**  
> When you’re studying God’s Word, focus on His words instead of other books, teachers, or opinions. Instead of asking “What do you think this means?” ask “What does this passage say?” If someone in your group likes to teach, gently remind them that God’s Holy Spirit and perfect Word can teach the group. We’re all here to learn, together. And don’t be afraid of silence or a pause in the discussion. God is working even when it’s quiet. Stay focused on His Word, stick to the passage, and trust God to do the rest.

---

### LOOKING FORWARD

In the last third of our time, we’ll focus on looking forward to discover how we can obey and train others by what we’ve learned from God’s word.  
Each member of the group asks God a few simple questions and then waits for His answer in prayer. Then we share and practice our commitments and pray to end our time, together.

#### Step 1 – Praying for God’s Purpose  
Have each person in your group pray silently and ask God these questions:  

- God, how can I obey and apply what You are teaching me?  
- Who can I train from this passage so they can learn to obey and love You more?  
- Who would you have me share my testimony or Your Good News of Jesus with?  

*Press pause and then pray.* (5 min)

Ask God’s Holy Spirit to give you specific answers, specific names, and specific steps that you can take in the time between now and when your group meets again.

#### Step 2 – Gathering Commitments  
Ask each person in your group to share what they heard from the Lord for each question.  
Someone may not have heard anything from the Lord on one, two, or even all three questions.  
They can simply report that they didn’t hear.  

But remember, the group should hear from the Lord. Jesus said – “My sheep hear My voice.”  
And the more specific your obedience steps are, the easier it will be to obey them before we meet again.  

*Press pause, and then share what you’ve heard.* (10 min)

#### Step 3 – Practicing your Plan  
Before you end your time together, have your 3/3 Group break into smaller groups of two or three and practice what you’ve heard the Lord ask you to do.  

Remember – practice isn’t obeying, training or sharing, but it does get you ready to do those things better.  
Have each smaller group end its practice time together in prayer. Pray specifically for those people and plans God has put on your hearts.  

If you have oral‑learners in the group, set aside part of your practice time to re‑read the passage of God’s Word you read earlier. This will help the entire group be ready to share with others they meet between meetings.

*Press pause, then break into groups to practice and pray.* (10 min)  

Anyone who doesn’t have specific commitments should practice sharing their testimony story or God’s Story.

---

### COMPLETING OUR TIME TOGETHER

As you bring your group back together, take a moment to celebrate!  
You’ve completed the Looking Forward section and have now practiced the entire 3/3 Group format.

Your group will continue to practice without this video guide in later sessions. Be sure to take turns letting others guide the group through the process. You don’t have to be a gifted teacher, just follow these simple steps.

Before you go, here’s one more suggestion to help your sessions go even better:

> **ZÚME COACHING TIP**  
> Around the world, 3/3 groups often share the Lord’s Supper, or a meal and more casual conversations as part of their time together.  
> God gave us this kind of fellowship – intentional learning and growth and intentional living and relationship to help strengthen, encourage, and build us up to be more like His Son, Jesus.

And that’s it – your group has now practiced all three parts – Looking Back to check in on what we've accomplished since the last time we met, Looking Up to understand what God has for us to learn in this time together, and Looking Forward to put into action what God has put on our hearts while we're apart.

> **3/3 Groups** – a simple and practical way to meet that helps us become more like Jesus.

---

## DISCUSS  
**(10 min)**  

- Did you notice any differences between a 3/3 Group and a Bible Study or Small Group you’ve been a part of (or have heard about) in the past? If so, how would those differences impact the group?  
- Could a 3/3 Group be considered a Simple Church? Why or why not?

## Overview (1 min)

In this session, we will hear and discuss this concept: **The Training Cycle**.  
And we will add this tool to our toolkit: **3/3 Group Meeting**.

## Read (5 min)

### The Training Cycle

In this session, we’ll learn **THE TRAINING CYCLE** that helps disciples go from one to many and turns a mission into a movement.

> Have you ever learned how to ride a bicycle?  
> Have you ever helped someone else learn?  
> If so, chances are you already know THE TRAINING CYCLE.  
> It’s as easy as **MODEL, ASSIST, WATCH and LEAVE**.

- **Modeling** is simply showing someone else an example of how it’s done.  
  When a child first sees someone else riding a bike, they get the idea right away.  
  Modeling is like that – it doesn’t have to be done often, and usually it only needs to be done once.

- **Assisting** is allowing a learner to practice a skill but making sure the falls aren’t too hard.  
  Assisting takes longer than modeling, but not too long. It requires some hand‑holding, direction and coaching, but it’s just about passing on the basics.  
  It’s not about getting someone to perfect; it’s about getting them to pedal.

- **Watching** is influencing a learner until they’re competent in their skill, all without having to step in and take control.  
  Watching is about making sure someone’s going to be safe – even when no one’s around.  
  Watching is about making sure not just that someone knows what to do, but also that they’ll do it – even when no one’s looking.

- **Leaving** is like a graduation. A student becomes a teacher, a worker becomes a co‑worker, a disciple becomes a friend.  
  In bike riding, the one who teaches you to ride doesn’t go along for every ride you take.  
  Leaving is about giving one last gift to someone you love – the gift of freedom.

> **MODEL, ASSIST, WATCH and LEAVE.**  
> The Training Cycle: From one to many. From a mission to a movement.

### Discussion (10 min)

Have you ever been a part of a Training Cycle?  
Who did you train? Or who trained you? Could the same person be at different parts of the Training Cycle while learning different skills?  
What would it look like to train someone like that?

## Activity (60–90 min)

### 3/3 Group Meeting

#### Look Back – Use last session’s *Obey, Train, and Share* challenges to check‑in with each other. (30 min)

#### Look Up – Use Mark 5:1–20 as your group’s reading passage and answer questions 1‑4 during the Look Up section. (30 min)

#### Look Forward – Use questions 5, 6, and 7 in the Look Forward section to develop how you will *Obey, Train* and *Share*. (30 min)

---

### Looking Back

1. **Giving Thanks**  
   Take some time to have each person share something they are thankful for.

2. **Sharing your Struggles and Praying for One Another**  
   Have each person in your group briefly share something they are struggling with.  
   Have someone else pray for them about what they share.

3. **Focusing the Group**  
   Take time and remember why you’re together – to love God, to love others, to share Jesus, and help others share Him too.

4. **Checking In**  
   Have each person answer the following questions:  
   - How have you obeyed what you’ve learned so far?  
   - Who have you trained in what you’ve learned?  
   - Who have you shared your story or God’s story with since we’ve been together as a group?

---

### Looking Up

1. **Invite God’s Holy Spirit to Lead**  
   Take a moment to pray. Talk with God simply and briefly. Ask His Holy Spirit to teach you from the passage you are about to read.

2. **Read God’s Word and Ask Questions**  
   Have someone in the group read from the Bible. When you’ve finished reading, the group should answer these two questions:  
   - What did you like about this passage?  
   - What did you find challenging or hard to understand?  

   Read the same passage a second time, and then have the group answer these two questions:  
   - What can we learn about people from this passage?  
   - What can we learn about God from this passage?  

   Remember stick to the passage and keep it simple!

---

### Looking Forward

1. **Praying for God’s Purpose**  
   Have each person in your group pray silently and ask God these questions:  
   - *God, how can I obey and apply what You’re teaching me?*  
   - *Who can I train from this passage so they can learn to obey and love You more?*  
   - *Who would you have me share my testimony or Your Good News of Jesus with?*  

   Ask God’s Holy Spirit to give you specific answers, specific names, and specific steps that you can take in the time between now and when your group meets again.

2. **Gathering Commitments**  
   Ask each person in your group to share what they heard from the Lord for each question. Someone may not have heard anything from the Lord on one, two, or even all three questions. They can simply report that they didn’t hear.  
   But remember, the group should hear from the Lord. Jesus said – “My sheep hear My voice.” And the more specific your obedience steps are, the easier it will be to obey them before we meet again.

3. **Practicing your Plan**  
   Before you end your time together, have your 3/3 Group break into smaller groups of two or three and practice what you’ve heard the Lord ask you to do.

## OVERVIEW (1 min)

- In this session, we will hear and discuss this concept: **Leadership Cells**  
- And we will practice this tool from our toolkit: **3/3 Group Meeting**

## READ (5 min)

### Leadership Cells

In this session, we’ll learn how **LEADERSHIP CELLS** prepare followers in a short time to become leaders for a lifetime. One becomes two. Two becomes four. Four becomes eight. This is individual multiplication, generational increase, and exponential growth. This is the model God built into His creation and the way He intends His family to grow.

We’ve already learned the 3/3rds pattern that turns consumers into producers, learners into leaders, and disciples into disciple‑makers: Look Back – Look Up – Look Forward. Learn – Obey – Share. This way of meeting together produces ongoing spiritual growth in individual believers and ongoing reproductive growth in a group of followers of Jesus. This pattern helps disciples multiply.

But what if a group is together for only a short period of time? Can they still grow and reproduce God’s Kingdom? Leadership Cells are a way to put the 3/3rds pattern to work when you know there’s a limit to how long a group can be together. Leadership Cells equip individual believers in a short time to learn reproductive patterns that last a lifetime. They help learners become leaders who will then start new groups, train new churches, and begin more Leadership Cells to grow God’s family.

Leadership Cells work well when a group is mobile. Nomads, students, military personnel, and seasonal workers who already follow Jesus are great candidates for a Leadership Cell. Because of their culture, profession, or season of life, they may have a hard time establishing an ongoing group, but they can absolutely be trained to start groups in each place they travel.

Leadership Cells also work well when a group of people come to faith at the same time. A family, a network of friends, or even a small village can be trained in a short time to become producers for a lifetime—even without individual follow‑ups or spiritual coaching.

In an earlier session, we learned and practiced the last two parts of the 3/3rds pattern. Now we will practice the entire pattern—all three parts: looking back, looking up, and looking forward.

## DISCUSS (10 min)

- Is there a group of followers of Jesus you know that are already meeting or would be willing to meet and form a Leadership Cell to learn Zúme Training?  
- What would it take to bring them together?

- **Non‑Sequential Growth**  
- **Pace**  
- **Always Part of Two Churches**

And we will add this tool to our toolkit:

- Coaching Checklist  
- Four Fields  
- Generational Mapping

## READ (5 min)

### Non‑Sequential Growth

In this session we’ll learn how to break the habit of thinking in a linear pattern as a way of accelerating kingdom growth. To make disciples who make disciples more quickly, we have to keep in mind that multiple things can happen at the same time and there is not a certain order in which they need to happen.

We have to learn the power of **NON‑SEQUENTIAL growth**. When people think about disciples multiplying, they often think of it as a step‑by‑step process:

1. First prayer.  
2. Then preparation.  
3. Then sharing God’s good news.  
4. Then building disciples.  
5. Then building churches.  
6. Then developing leaders.  
7. Then reproduction.

When we learn this way, kingdom growth seems to be an easy‑to‑follow, linear and sequential process. One problem is that’s not how it always works. A bigger problem is that’s not how it often works best.

> This line represents a person’s life. Here’s birth. Here’s the first time they hear God’s good news.  
> Here’s when they choose to follow Jesus. Here’s when they first share their story and God’s story and they begin to multiply. And here’s where this life ends. So from here to here – from first hearing about Jesus to first sharing about Jesus – is what we could consider a spiritual generation.

This amount of time before multiplying. This amount of time before God’s family grows. This is how discipleship is usually taught. But when we use a pattern like Greatest Blessing – watch what happens.

Now a new disciple starts multiplying immediately. The spiritual generation shortens. Someone hears God’s good news sooner. God’s family grows more quickly. More people are saved for eternity.

And all of it – simply by moving when they multiply. But what if we keep going? What if someone starts multiplying even earlier? What if they begin to share after they first hear instead of after they first believe?

Some are open to gathering a group and sharing what they learn from God’s Word with friends and family before they ever say “yes” to Jesus. If we show those people how to gather a group and share what they learn and show others how to do the same, God’s family grows even faster.

Now discipleship is a path to Jesus not just something we share after salvation. This is a way a family or friends or even a village can come to follow Jesus. But what if someone can multiply even sooner? What if someone could share God’s ways before they even meet God’s Son?

Sometimes a group may be unable or not ready to hear God’s good news immediately. But this group can still learn God’s patterns – through efforts like community development or leadership training. This group can begin multiplying God’s patterns – learning, obeying, sharing – and teaching others to do the same even before they first hear about Jesus.

When this happens, God’s ways are imprinted into willing hearts. His patterns are woven into a community and individual lives. Then when God has prepared His way – God’s good news can reveal the truth they’ve been receiving all along. This is the way an institution, a community, or even a country can come to follow Jesus.

**Non‑Sequential growth still requires “What’s Essential?” thinking.** No matter what process – the biggest question is always the same – Who is the good soil that will be faithful? Who will learn and practice and share God’s ways? Uncovering this good soil – discovering these good hearts – is worth all of our time, energy and effort. These are the ones we pour out our hearts to. These are the ones we pour out our lives for. These are the ones who grow God’s kingdom best.

## READ (5 min)

### Pace

In this session we will learn why multiplying matters and why multiplying quickly matters even more. This session is about **PACE**. Pace is about time – how quickly or slowly things happen. Pace matters because where we all spend our eternity – an existence that outlasts time – is determined in the short time we call “life”.

God’s Word tells us that God is patient with us – not wanting anyone to perish, but everyone to turn around and follow Him. God gives us more time because He knows we only have a short time to do all He’s called us to do and to reach all He’s called us to reach.

To follow Jesus more closely, we have to pursue His people more quickly. We can’t just take our time. We have to increase our PACE.

The global church – all followers of Jesus, together – is larger than it’s ever been. The global church – all followers of Jesus, together – is a larger portion of the world’s population than ever before. But even with those large numbers – the global church is not growing faster than the global population.

That means that while there are more of us who follow Jesus than ever before, there are even more who are not following Jesus and will spend their eternity separated from Him – more than there have ever been before.

Making disciples who multiply matters. Start with just one disciple. If they multiply and make a new disciple once every 18 months – an entire year and a half – and then those disciples do the same – in 10 years, there will be **64 new followers of Jesus**. 64 people will spend their forever with a loving God.

But what if they moved a little faster? What if they increased their PACE?

If they multiply now in **4 months** – a quarter of a year – instead of 18 months, and those disciples do the same – in 10 years, there will now be a **billion new followers of Jesus**. Think about that. Instead of less than a hundred, more than 1,000,000,000.

All by increasing PACE.

Going from 18 months to 4 months means we’re moving four‑and‑a‑half times faster. But that acceleration applied to every disciple over the course of 10 years means God’s family is growing **15 MILLION TIMES faster**. Less than a hundred, more than a billion.

PACE matters.

Sharing our story and God’s story and leading someone to follow Jesus grows God’s family. Sharing with a new follower how to do exactly the same grows God’s family like a wildfire. Exponentially. Like yeast through a loaf.

Like Zúme.

All because of PACE.

### DISCUSS (10 min)

- Why is pace important?  
- What do you need to change in your thinking, your actions, or your attitude to be better aligned with God’s priority for pace?  
- What is one thing you can do starting this week that will make a difference?

### Always Part of Two Churches

In this session, we’ll learn how followers of Jesus can be a **PART OF TWO CHURCHES** to accelerate growth and help turn a faithful spiritual family into a growing city‑wide body of believers.

In God’s Word – we learn that His perfect plan is for us to live as a spiritual family. The Bible talks about this family as a church in three forms:

1. **The universal church** – the gathering of all the believers who were, who are and who will be.  
2. **The regional or city church** – the gathering of all the believers in a city or a part of a country.  
3. **The simple church** – the gathering of believers who meet in a small group like in a building or a home.

This smallest group – this elemental church – is the spiritual family that lives life together and it works best when that family can meet and work together for months or years at a time. At the same time, Jesus instructed His followers that they should be continuously starting new spiritual families, growing them to be more like Jesus, and helping them learn how to start new spiritual families, too.

Jesus told us – make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit, teaching them to obey all I have commanded. So how do these two things come together – how can we be a part of a church and be in the process of starting new churches – all at the same time?

> Imagine a basic church – just four families. Each pair of symbols represent a different couple who lead their home. All the couples are a part of one church – this is their ongoing spiritual family. This is who they do life with – the brothers and sisters who encourage them in love and good works.  
> But these same couples are also each working to start a new spiritual family. They’re not participating in the same way they do with their own small group family, but they are helping to **MODEL and ASSIST** as a new spiritual family gets started and grows.

Imagine this – just one church starting four new churches at the exact same time. This is how fast God can grow His family. This is how the church can increase its pace.

In an earlier session, we learned about the **TRAINING CYCLE – MODEL, ASSIST, WATCH and LEAVE** and we know that these first two phases – **MODEL** and **ASSIST** are meant to be moved through quickly – to keep new followers healthy and growing in their faith.

So what happens with the original church and the four churches that they’ve started? After helping them launch by Modeling and Assisting, these couples (original church) have already helped these new churches (1 gen) begin Modeling and Assisting, as well (for 2 gen). For these four new churches (1 gen), our couples (org. church) are now in the **WATCH** phase – keeping an eye on the progress of these new churches (1 gen) and coaching as they Model and Assist new churches (2 gen) they help start on their own.

Most people will not be able to Model and Assist for more than one other spiritual family at a time. But they can watch over and coach multiple churches and help them connect with peer mentors as they grow.

That means one single spiritual family – one small group church – can be part of launching many other small group churches at exactly the same time. That’s a lot of fruit. So what happens to all these churches as they grow and start new churches that start new churches that start new churches? How do they stay connected? How do they live life as an extended spiritual family?

The answer is that all of these simple churches are just like the cells in a growing body and they connect together and network into a city or regional church. The churches are related. They share the same spiritual DNA. They are all connected out of the same first multiplying family.

And now – with some guidance – they come together as a larger body to do even more.

### DISCUSS (10 min)

- What are some advantages of maintaining a consistent spiritual family that gives birth to new ones that grow and multiply, instead of continually growing a family and splitting it in order to grow?

## READ (5 min)

### Coaching Checklist

Jesus said – “Greater love has no one than this – to lay down one’s life for one’s friends.” Jesus told us then showed us again and again that God’s family grows best when we are willing to give up our wants for God’s will.

The Coaching Checklist is a simple tool you can use to help guide you as you assist others through various parts of Zúme Training like The Training Cycle or their List of 100.

What skills are you seeing develop in others? What areas still need to be developed?

Having a Coaching Checklist will help you stay focused and engaged as you develop followers of Jesus into leaders in God’s family, everywhere you go.

Yes, it takes time and effort. Yes, it means sacrifices and giving up our preferences for God’s perfect plan. And yes, more than all of that, it’s worth it.

The Coaching Checklist a simple tool from the Zúme Toolkit to help keep you in life’s greatest game – God’s Work.

## Four Fields

Jesus often pulled the disciples away from ministry to quieter places to review how the work was going. Four Fields is used by a leadership cell to reflect on current efforts and Kingdom activity around them. It especially helps leaders balance efforts, so that no field is overlooked.

### Field Descriptions

| Empty Field | Seeding Field | Growing Field | Harvesting Field | Multiplying Field |
|-------------|---------------|--------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Where or with whom (what people groups) are you planning to extend the Kingdom? | Where or with whom are you sharing the good news of the Kingdom? How are you doing that? | How are you equipping people and growing them spiritually, individually and in their natural networks? | How are new spiritual families (simple churches) being formed? | With whom, how and when are you filtering for faithful people and equipping them and holding them accountable for reproduction? |

### Four Fields Example

*(Insert your own example or use the template provided by Zúme.)*

---

## Generational Mapping

Generational mapping (a.k.a. generation mapping or gen mapping) is another simple tool to help leaders in a movement understand the growth around them. A generation tree map can be drawn on a piece of paper or multiple pieces of paper. This map helps show where there are stops in multiplication and training might be required. Health of the movement is a top concern for leaders and fruitfulness is a top way to measure health.

*(Insert your own generational mapping example or use the template provided by Zúme.)*

### DISCUSS (10 min)

- Identify an empty field around you. What communities or people groups that you are connected to have no gospel activity?  
- How is long‑term growth affected if one of the fields is neglected? Give examples.  
- Which Zúme tools could help in which field?

---

### DISCUSS (10 min)

Using the Generational Mapping example to discuss:

- Which leaders are seeing multiplication?  
- Which groups would you expect to multiply next?  
- Which leaders could help and strengthen other leaders?  
- Do you see a pattern of weak accountability in any of the generations?

- So what happens to churches as they grow and start new churches that start new churches that start new churches? How do they stay connected? How do they live life together as an extended spiritual family?
- The answer is that all of these simple churches are just like the cells in a growing body and they connect and network into a city or regional church. The churches are related. They share the same spiritual DNA. They are all connected out of the same first multiplying family.
- And now -- with some guidance -- they come together as a larger body to do even more. At the city and regional level, God’s Word shows that the growing body of believers is served by a new group of leaders.
- In the New Testament, the church calls these servants Elders and Deacons, Shepherds and Overseers of the flock.
- We learn in God’s Word that the multitude of small home churches in the city of Jerusalem were served by a group of 7 servants -- or deacons.
- We learn in God’s Word that the multitude of home churches in the city of Ephesus were served by a small group of Elders -- shepherds who were to follow the model of the Good Shepherd Jesus and lay down their lives for their flock.
- In the city or region, we also see a group of five leadership gifts given. God’s Word says -- Christ Himself gave the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, the pastors and teachers, to equip his people for works of service, so that the body of Christ may be built up.
- These spiritual gifts are given not so a small group can do all the work of the church but so they could serve and prepare the followers of Jesus to do the work -- so the whole body of believers could work together to accomplish all God has in His heart to do.
- In addition to or in place of meeting with their own spiritual family, these leaders meet and pray and fellowship and encourage one another in much the same way that any simple church in a home would.
- The 3/3rds pattern is used in leadership training meetings and peer mentoring. The Four Fields pattern is used for planning, evaluation and coaching at higher levels just as it is at the local level.
- When the leaders meet they share what is happening not only as individuals but also across their network. They represent the families and share about the well‑being of the ones they serve.
- A good place for a network of spiritual families to center is the place where that network starts. A church network that launches from Tampa will start as a city church in Tampa.
- As they grow and serve throughout the state, they will act on behalf of the network in Florida. As they send and serve around the country and around the world, they begin to function at a national or even international level.
- Jesus said - If you’re faithful in little things, you will be faithful in large ones.
- These networks of churches remain connected because of their common spiritual DNA and shared beginnings. Sometimes the networks split off into multiple networks based on language, opportunities to meet or other reasons.
- This is part of growth and not a problem. The willingness of simple churches and individual followers to learn, obey and share God’s Word is the spiritual DNA of a movement.
- If it is passed on successfully from generation to generation, from church to church and from believer to believer then everything needed to begin a new movement of multiplying disciples is already present in every spiritual family and in every follower of Jesus.
- When movements launch movements, that’s when... we start to see the “leaven” working through the dough of a city or a state or even a nation. That is how the Kingdom of God comes in such a way that God’s will is being done on earth as it is in heaven.
- That is how we can finish the Great Commission by making disciples of all nations.

### Peer Mentoring Groups

- Jesus said - “A new command I give you: Love one another. As I have loved you, so you must love one another. By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you love one another.”
- A Peer Mentoring Group is a group that consists of people who are leading and starting 3/3 Groups. It also follows a 3/3 format and is a powerful way to assess the spiritual health of God’s work in your area.
- Peer Mentoring Groups use leader‑to‑leader mentoring with individual followers of Jesus, with simple churches, with ministry organizations or even with a global simple church network that reaches around the world.
- Peer Mentoring Groups follow Jesus’ example of ministry from scripture, ask questions of one another and give feedback -- all using the same basic time structure as a 3/3 Group. The purpose of these groups is not to judge - to lift one member up and tear another down.
- Jesus said - “Do not judge, or you too will be judged. For in the same way you judge others, you will be judged, and with the measure you use, it will be measured to you.”
- Instead, the purpose of a Peer Mentoring Group is to provide a simple format for helping followers of Jesus grow through prayer, obedience, application and accountability. In other words -- “to love one another.”
- Here’s how it works:
  - LOOK BACK: During the first third - spend time in prayer and care just like you would in a basic 3/3 Group. Then spend time looking at the group’s vision - How well are we individually abiding in Jesus as we read scripture, pray, trust and obey God, and live out key relationships? Finally during this first third, have the group review and respond to each individual’s action plans and commitments made in the last session.
  - LOOK UP: The middle third of the group’s time is spent Looking Up for God’s wisdom and direction through scripture, discussion and prayer. Offer a brief and simple prayer, asking God to teach you His will and His ways through His Word. Ask the Holy Spirit to lead your time.
    - Group members should share what they have learned from the Lord about their area of leadership - either through God’s Word, Prayer or from Other Followers.
    - Have the group discuss the following simple questions:
      1. How are you doing in each section of the Four Fields diagram?
      2. What is working well? What are your biggest challenges?
      3. Review your current generational map.
      4. What challenged you or what did you find hard to understand?
      5. What is God showing you recently?
      6. Are there any questions and feedback from seasoned leaders or other participants?
  - LOOK FORWARD: The final third of the group’s time is spent Looking Forward to how we can each apply and obey what we’ve learned. Spend time in silent prayer with everyone in the group asking the Holy Spirit to show them how to answer these questions:
    - What action plans or goals would God have me put into practice before our next time together? (Use the Four Fields tool to help focus your work)
    - How can my Mentor or other Group Members help me in this work?
    - Finally spend time as a group talking to God in prayer. Have the group pray so that each member is prayed for and ask God to prepare the hearts of all those the group will reach out to during their time apart.
    - Pray for God to give each member of the group the courage and strength to apply and obey what God has taught them in this session.
    - If a seasoned leader needs to pray specifically for a younger leader, this is the perfect time for that prayer.
    - Since these groups often meet at a distance, you are unlikely to be able to celebrate The Lord’s Supper or share a meal, but be sure to make time to check‑in about health and family and friends.
- Jesus showed us again and again that even though He accomplished the most important works, He balanced it, always, with time for the ones He loved. A Peer Mentoring Group is a simple but strategic tool from the Zúme Toolbox to develop stronger leaders.

## ACTIVITY (45 min)

### Peer Mentoring Group Practice

- Break into groups of two or three. Use the 3/3 formatted Peer Mentoring Group outline.
- Three-Month Plan
- In His Bible, God says, "I know the plans I have for you, plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future."
- God makes plans, and He expects us to make plans, too.
- A Three Month Plan is a tool you can use to help focus your attention and efforts and keep them aligned with God’s priorities for making disciples who multiply.
- Choose one person in the group to be the "mentee" and have the other members work through the suggested questions list as peer mentors.
- Simple format for leading a Peer Mentoring Group:
  - LOOK BACK – 1/3 of your time
    - During the first third – spend time in prayer and care just like you would in a basic 3/3 Group. Then spend time looking at the group’s vision and faithfulness in previous commitments: How well are you abiding in Christ? [Scripture, prayer, trust, obedience, key relationships?] Did your group complete your action plans from the last session? Review them.
  - LOOK UP – 1/3 of your time
    - Have the group discuss the following simple questions:
      1. How are you doing in each section of the Four Fields diagram?
      2. What is working well? What are your biggest challenges?
      3. Review your current generational map.
      4. What challenged you or what did you find hard to understand?
      5. What is God showing you recently?
      6. Are there any questions from seasoned leaders or other participants?
  - LOOK FORWARD – 1/3 of your time
    - Spend time in silent prayer with everyone in the group asking the Holy Spirit to show them how to answer these questions:
      - What action plans or goals would God have me put into practice before our next time together? [Use the Four Fields tool to help focus your work]
      - How can my Mentor or other Group Members help me in this work?
    - Finally spend time as a group talking to God in prayer.

### Leadership in Networks

- In this session, we’ll learn how **LEADERSHIP IN NETWORKS** allows a growing group of small churches to work together, grow new leaders and accomplish even more of the good things God has planned for His people.
