### Non‑Sequential Growth

In this session we’ll learn how to break the habit of thinking in a linear pattern as a way of accelerating kingdom growth. To make disciples who make disciples more quickly, we have to keep in mind that multiple things can happen at the same time and there is not a certain order in which they need to happen.

We have to learn the power of **NON‑SEQUENTIAL growth**. When people think about disciples multiplying, they often think of it as a step‑by‑step process:

1. First prayer.  
2. Then preparation.  
3. Then sharing God’s good news.  
4. Then building disciples.  
5. Then building churches.  
6. Then developing leaders.  
7. Then reproduction.

When we learn this way, kingdom growth seems to be an easy‑to‑follow, linear and sequential process. One problem is that’s not how it always works. A bigger problem is that’s not how it often works best.

> This line represents a person’s life. Here’s birth. Here’s the first time they hear God’s good news.  
> Here’s when they choose to follow Jesus. Here’s when they first share their story and God’s story and they begin to multiply. And here’s where this life ends. So from here to here – from first hearing about Jesus to first sharing about Jesus – is what we could consider a spiritual generation.

This amount of time before multiplying. This amount of time before God’s family grows. This is how discipleship is usually taught. But when we use a pattern like Greatest Blessing – watch what happens.

Now a new disciple starts multiplying immediately. The spiritual generation shortens. Someone hears God’s good news sooner. God’s family grows more quickly. More people are saved for eternity.

And all of it – simply by moving when they multiply. But what if we keep going? What if someone starts multiplying even earlier? What if they begin to share after they first hear instead of after they first believe?

Some are open to gathering a group and sharing what they learn from God’s Word with friends and family before they ever say “yes” to Jesus. If we show those people how to gather a group and share what they learn and show others how to do the same, God’s family grows even faster.

Now discipleship is a path to Jesus not just something we share after salvation. This is a way a family or friends or even a village can come to follow Jesus. But what if someone can multiply even sooner? What if someone could share God’s ways before they even meet God’s Son?

Sometimes a group may be unable or not ready to hear God’s good news immediately. But this group can still learn God’s patterns – through efforts like community development or leadership training. This group can begin multiplying God’s patterns – learning, obeying, sharing – and teaching others to do the same even before they first hear about Jesus.

When this happens, God’s ways are imprinted into willing hearts. His patterns are woven into a community and individual lives. Then when God has prepared His way – God’s good news can reveal the truth they’ve been receiving all along. This is the way an institution, a community, or even a country can come to follow Jesus.

**Non‑Sequential growth still requires “What’s Essential?” thinking.** No matter what process – the biggest question is always the same – Who is the good soil that will be faithful? Who will learn and practice and share God’s ways? Uncovering this good soil – discovering these good hearts – is worth all of our time, energy and effort. These are the ones we pour out our hearts to. These are the ones we pour out our lives for. These are the ones who grow God’s kingdom best.

### Pace

In this session we will learn why multiplying matters and why multiplying quickly matters even more. This session is about **PACE**. Pace is about time – how quickly or slowly things happen. Pace matters because where we all spend our eternity – an existence that outlasts time – is determined in the short time we call “life”.

God’s Word tells us that God is patient with us – not wanting anyone to perish, but everyone to turn around and follow Him. God gives us more time because He knows we only have a short time to do all He’s called us to do and to reach all He’s called us to reach.

To follow Jesus more closely, we have to pursue His people more quickly. We can’t just take our time. We have to increase our PACE.

The global church – all followers of Jesus, together – is larger than it’s ever been. The global church – all followers of Jesus, together – is a larger portion of the world’s population than ever before. But even with those large numbers – the global church is not growing faster than the global population.

That means that while there are more of us who follow Jesus than ever before, there are even more who are not following Jesus and will spend their eternity separated from Him – more than there have ever been before.

Making disciples who multiply matters. Start with just one disciple. If they multiply and make a new disciple once every 18 months – an entire year and a half – and then those disciples do the same – in 10 years, there will be **64 new followers of Jesus**. 64 people will spend their forever with a loving God.

But what if they moved a little faster? What if they increased their PACE?

If they multiply now in **4 months** – a quarter of a year – instead of 18 months, and those disciples do the same – in 10 years, there will now be a **billion new followers of Jesus**. Think about that. Instead of less than a hundred, more than 1,000,000,000.

All by increasing PACE.

Going from 18 months to 4 months means we’re moving four‑and‑a‑half times faster. But that acceleration applied to every disciple over the course of 10 years means God’s family is growing **15 MILLION TIMES faster**. Less than a hundred, more than a billion.

PACE matters.

Sharing our story and God’s story and leading someone to follow Jesus grows God’s family. Sharing with a new follower how to do exactly the same grows God’s family like a wildfire. Exponentially. Like yeast through a loaf.

Like Zúme.

All because of PACE.

### Always Part of Two Churches

In this session, we’ll learn how followers of Jesus can be a **PART OF TWO CHURCHES** to accelerate growth and help turn a faithful spiritual family into a growing city‑wide body of believers.

In God’s Word – we learn that His perfect plan is for us to live as a spiritual family. The Bible talks about this family as a church in three forms:

1. **The universal church** – the gathering of all the believers who were, who are and who will be.  
2. **The regional or city church** – the gathering of all the believers in a city or a part of a country.  
3. **The simple church** – the gathering of believers who meet in a small group like in a building or a home.

This smallest group – this elemental church – is the spiritual family that lives life together and it works best when that family can meet and work together for months or years at a time. At the same time, Jesus instructed His followers that they should be continuously starting new spiritual families, growing them to be more like Jesus, and helping them learn how to start new spiritual families, too.

Jesus told us – make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit, teaching them to obey all I have commanded. So how do these two things come together – how can we be a part of a church and be in the process of starting new churches – all at the same time?

> Imagine a basic church – just four families. Each pair of symbols represent a different couple who lead their home. All the couples are a part of one church – this is their ongoing spiritual family. This is who they do life with – the brothers and sisters who encourage them in love and good works.  
> But these same couples are also each working to start a new spiritual family. They’re not participating in the same way they do with their own small group family, but they are helping to **MODEL and ASSIST** as a new spiritual family gets started and grows.

Imagine this – just one church starting four new churches at the exact same time. This is how fast God can grow His family. This is how the church can increase its pace.

In an earlier session, we learned about the **TRAINING CYCLE – MODEL, ASSIST, WATCH and LEAVE** and we know that these first two phases – **MODEL** and **ASSIST** are meant to be moved through quickly – to keep new followers healthy and growing in their faith.

So what happens with the original church and the four churches that they’ve started? After helping them launch by Modeling and Assisting, these couples (original church) have already helped these new churches (1 gen) begin Modeling and Assisting, as well (for 2 gen). For these four new churches (1 gen), our couples (org. church) are now in the **WATCH** phase – keeping an eye on the progress of these new churches (1 gen) and coaching as they Model and Assist new churches (2 gen) they help start on their own.

Most people will not be able to Model and Assist for more than one other spiritual family at a time. But they can watch over and coach multiple churches and help them connect with peer mentors as they grow.

That means one single spiritual family – one small group church – can be part of launching many other small group churches at exactly the same time. That’s a lot of fruit. So what happens to all these churches as they grow and start new churches that start new churches that start new churches? How do they stay connected? How do they live life as an extended spiritual family?

The answer is that all of these simple churches are just like the cells in a growing body and they connect together and network into a city or regional church. The churches are related. They share the same spiritual DNA. They are all connected out of the same first multiplying family.

And now – with some guidance – they come together as a larger body to do even more.

### DISCUSS (10 min)

- What are some advantages of maintaining a consistent spiritual family that gives birth to new ones that grow and multiply, instead of continually growing a family and splitting it in order to grow?

### Coaching Checklist

Jesus said – “Greater love has no one than this – to lay down one’s life for one’s friends.” Jesus told us then showed us again and again that God’s family grows best when we are willing to give up our wants for God’s will.

The Coaching Checklist is a simple tool you can use to help guide you as you assist others through various parts of Zúme Training like The Training Cycle or their List of 100.

What skills are you seeing develop in others? What areas still need to be developed?

Having a Coaching Checklist will help you stay focused and engaged as you develop followers of Jesus into leaders in God’s family, everywhere you go.

Yes, it takes time and effort. Yes, it means sacrifices and giving up our preferences for God’s perfect plan. And yes, more than all of that, it’s worth it.

The Coaching Checklist a simple tool from the Zúme Toolkit to help keep you in life’s greatest game – God’s Work.

## Four Fields

Jesus often pulled the disciples away from ministry to quieter places to review how the work was going. Four Fields is used by a leadership cell to reflect on current efforts and Kingdom activity around them. It especially helps leaders balance efforts, so that no field is overlooked.

### Field Descriptions

| Empty Field | Seeding Field | Growing Field | Harvesting Field | Multiplying Field |
|-------------|---------------|--------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Where or with whom (what people groups) are you planning to extend the Kingdom? | Where or with whom are you sharing the good news of the Kingdom? How are you doing that? | How are you equipping people and growing them spiritually, individually and in their natural networks? | How are new spiritual families (simple churches) being formed? | With whom, how and when are you filtering for faithful people and equipping them and holding them accountable for reproduction? |

### Four Fields Example

*(Insert your own example or use the template provided by Zúme.)*

## Generational Mapping

Generational mapping (a.k.a. generation mapping or gen mapping) is another simple tool to help leaders in a movement understand the growth around them. A generation tree map can be drawn on a piece of paper or multiple pieces of paper. This map helps show where there are stops in multiplication and training might be required. Health of the movement is a top concern for leaders and fruitfulness is a top way to measure health.

*(Insert your own generational mapping example or use the template provided by Zúme.)*

## NEXT STEP

### OBEY

Practice sharing the concept of **“Pace”** with a friend and pray for the Lord to ingrain it deeply within your heart and soul. Ask the Lord whom He would have you share it with.

### SHARE

If you have already started your own simple church, share the concept **“Always a Part of Two Churches”** with the people in it. If not, share it with another believer you know.
