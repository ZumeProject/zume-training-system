## READ (5 min)

### God Uses Ordinary People

Welcome to Zúme training. **Zúme** is the Greek word for “yeast.”  

Jesus tells us that the Kingdom of God is like a woman who took a small amount of **zúme** and put it into a great amount of dough. As she worked the yeast into the mix, it spread until all of the dough was leavened. Jesus was showing us that an ordinary person can take something very small and use it to make a big impact!

Our dream is to do what Jesus said – to help ordinary people around the world use small tools to make a big impact in God’s kingdom!

Jesus’ final instructions to His followers were simple. He said — **All authority in heaven and earth has been given to Me. Therefore – Go and Make Disciples of all nations, baptizing Them in the name of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit, teaching them to obey all I have commanded, And I will be with you always - even to the end of the age.**

Jesus’ command was simple – **Make Disciples**  
His instructions on how to do that were simple – **Make disciples wherever you’re going. Make disciples by baptizing them in the name of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit. Make disciples by teaching them to obey all He commanded.**

So what are the steps to make a disciple?  
We make disciples all the time – wherever we’re going and as we go.  

When someone decides to follow Jesus, they should be baptized.  
As they grow – we should teach every disciple how to obey everything that Jesus commanded.

Since one of the things He commanded is to make disciples, that means every disciple who follows Jesus needs to learn how to make disciples too. Those disciples are to make disciples, and those disciples are to make disciples, too. **Multiplying disciples.** That’s how Zúme works – it’s like yeast, worked all through the dough until all of the dough is leavened.

When Jesus gave this command to go make disciples, He also gave a promise.  
Jesus said – *I will be with you always.* Even to the very end of the age. Every follower of Jesus should count on that promise because He is with us!  
But that also means every follower of Jesus should commit to the fact that Jesus wants each of us to make disciples. Because He does.

Jesus said – **All authority in heaven and earth has been given to Me.** Therefore go and make disciples.  
The authority that Jesus relies on when He sends us – is His authority. Jesus says there is no higher authority than that. No tradition, culture, or earthly law has more authority.

Jesus said – *Go and make disciples.* And like Zúme – like yeast – we’ll keep going and growing until all the work is done.

### Disciples and the Church

Welcome back to Zúme training. In this session, we’ll talk about disciples and the church.

**What is a disciple? And how do you make one? How do you teach a follower of Jesus to obey all of His commands? How do you take someone who’s lived their life as a captive of the world and equip them to become a citizen of God’s kingdom?**

The meaning of the word disciple is a follower. So a disciple is a follower of God. Jesus said – *All authority in heaven and earth has been given to Me.* So in God’s kingdom, Jesus is our King. We are His citizens, subjects of His will. His desires, purposes, intentions, priorities and values are the highest and best. His Word is the law.

So what is the law of the kingdom? What does Jesus tell His citizens to do?  
Jesus said – *Love the Lord God with all your heart, soul, mind and strength.* Jesus said – *Love your neighbor as yourself.* Jesus said that God’s commands from the Old Testament – all the law and the prophets – can be summarized in these two things – **Love God** and **Love People.** Jesus said – *Make disciples.* Jesus said – *Teach them to obey all that I’ve commanded.* Since making disciples includes teaching them all that Jesus commanded – the New Testament can be summarized in one thing – **Make Disciples.**

A disciple is a follower of Jesus who loves God, loves people and makes disciples.

**What is a church?**  
You may be used to thinking of the church as a building – a place where you go. But God’s Word talks about the church as a gathering – a people you belong to.

The word “church” is used in the Bible three different ways:

1. The **universal church** – all the people who were, are and will ever be followers of Jesus.  
2. The **city or regional church** – all the people who follow Jesus and live in or around a certain area of the world.  
3. The **church at home** – all the people who follow Jesus and meet where one or more of them live.

A spiritual family – followers of Jesus who love God, love people and make disciples – and who meet together locally make up this last kind of church – the **church at home** or the simple church.

When groups of these simple churches connect to do something bigger, together, they can form a city or regional church. All of those simple churches networked into regions and stretched across history make up the **universal church**.

> **THAT’S CHURCH WITH A CAPITAL “C”**

Simple churches are spiritual families with Jesus as their center and their king. Simple churches are spiritual families who love God, love others and make disciples who multiply. Some churches have buildings and programs and budgets and staff. But simple churches don’t need any of these things to love God, love others and make disciples who multiply. And since anything extra makes a church more complicated and harder to multiply, our training leaves things like buildings, programs, budgets and staff to the city or regional church built from multiplying simple churches.

Remember “zúme” means “yeast” – a single‑cell organism that reproduces quickly. With Zúme training, we’re going to be like that yeast – simple and multiplying. But before we start multiplying – let’s make sure we know what God wants reproduced. Because multiplication can be good, but not always. Cancer is multiplication. And it’s deadly. So how do we reproduce life and not death? And how do we make sure we’re disciples worth reproducing?

### Hearing and Obeying God

Welcome back to Zúme training. In this session, we’ll talk about hearing from God and obeying what we hear.

Breathing is life. We breathe in. We breathe out. Life.  
Breathing is just as important in God’s Kingdom. In fact, God calls His Spirit – “breath.”

In the Kingdom we breathe **IN** when we hear from God. We breathe in when we hear from God through His Word – the Bible. We breathe in when we hear from God through prayer – our conversations with Him. We breathe in when we hear from God through His body – the church, other followers of Jesus. We breathe in when we hear from God through His works – events, experiences and sometimes even the persecutions and sufferings He allows His children to go through.

In the Kingdom we breathe **OUT** when we act on what we hear from God. We breathe out when we obey.

Sometimes breathing out to obey means changing our thoughts, words or actions to bring them into alignment with Jesus and His will. Sometimes breathing out to obey means sharing what Jesus has shared with us – giving away what He gave us so that others can be blessed just as God is blessing us.

For a follower of Jesus – this breathing IN and breathing OUT is critical. It’s our very life.  
Jesus said – *The Son can do nothing by himself.* He does only what he sees the Father doing. Whatever the Father does, the Son also does.  
Jesus said – *I don’t speak on my own authority.* The Father who sent me has commanded what to say and how to say it.  
Jesus said that every word He spoke and every work He accomplished was based on hearing from God and obeying what He heard.

Breathe IN – hear from God. Breathe OUT – obey what you hear and share it with others.

Jesus said that His followers would also hear from God because of His Holy Spirit – His breath – that would be breathed into every one of us who follows Him.

Jesus said – *The Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, will teach you all things and remind you of everything that I have told you.* Breathe IN – hear from God. Breathe OUT – obey what you hear and share it with others.

Jesus was showing us how to live.  
So how do we hear God’s voice? How do we know what to obey?

Jesus called Himself “The Good Shepherd.” Jesus called His followers “His sheep.”  
Jesus said – *My sheep hear My voice, and I know them, and they follow Me.*  
Jesus said – *Whoever belongs to God hears what God says.* The reason you do not hear is that you do not belong to God.

As followers of Jesus, we have to be committed to hearing His voice.  
We HEAR His voice by being still.  
We HEAR His voice by focusing on Jesus.  
We HEAR His voice in our thoughts, our visions, our feelings and impressions.  
We HEAR His voice when we write down and test what we hear.

Not every voice, not every thought, not every vision, feeling or impression is God’s voice. Sometimes it is the voice of the enemy. Jesus said our enemy is a liar and the father of lies. Jesus said our enemy comes to steal, kill and destroy.

But God says that we **will** hear from Him and we will know it is Him when He speaks. With practice and prayer, we can learn to hear God’s voice better. We can learn to know whether what we hear is from God or another voice.

**Here are some ways to test what we hear:**

1. When Jesus speaks – His voice will always be consistent with what His Written Word – the Bible – has already told us.  
2. When Jesus speaks – His voice will give our hearts a sense of hope and peace.  
3. When Jesus speaks – His voice will not leave us condemned or discouraged. Jesus does not condemn; He corrects in love.  
4. When Jesus speaks – His voice will not express the works of the flesh – sexual immorality and impurity, debauchery, idolatry and witchcraft, hatred and discord, jealousy and fits of rage, selfish ambitions, dissensions, factions and envy, drunkenness and orgies. These things are not from God’s voice.  
5. When Jesus speaks – His voice will express the fruit of God’s Spirit – love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self‑control.  
6. When Jesus speaks – His voice will give us a sense of confidence instead of doubt. We experience inside ourselves a knowledge and peace that what we’re hearing is from God.  
7. We may not hear everything at once. We may hear only part of what we eventually will need to know. But what we hear will be solid – not shifting or changing.

The good news for every follower of Jesus is that when we breathe IN and HEAR from God and when we breathe OUT and OBEY what we hear and SHARE with others what we’ve heard – God will speak even more clearly. His breath will breathe through us even more. We will HEAR His voice more clearly. We will KNOW His voice and not another’s. We will SEE His work in the world and be able to join in and work with Him.

### S.O.A.P.S. Bible Reading

Jesus said – “make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit and teaching them to obey all that I commanded…”

If every follower of Jesus is going to obey all that Jesus commanded, then they need to know what Jesus commands. The Great Commandment and the Great Commission are a great summary of what God has to say to us, but if a follower is going to grow into the full measure of what God created them to be, then they need to know and obey even more.

**S.O.A.P.S.** stands for:

- **Scripture**  
- **Observation**  
- **Application**  
- **Prayer**  
- **Sharing**

It’s a simple way to learn and remember an effective Bible study method that any follower of Jesus can use.  

### When you read or listen to the Bible:

| Step | What to do |
|------|------------|
| **Scripture** | Write out one or more verses that are particularly meaningful to you, today. |
| **Observation** | Rewrite those verses or key points from those scriptures in your own words to help you better understand the meaning. |
| **Application** | Think about what it means to obey these commands or concepts in your own life. What would you have to do? What would you have to do differently? Write these down. |
| **Prayer** | Write out a prayer that tells God what you’ve read in His word and what you understand about obeying His commands and putting what you’ve learned to work. |
| **Sharing** | Ask God who He wants you to share with about what you’ve learned and how you’re applying it. |

---

### Example of S.O.A.P.S.

- **Scripture** – *“For my thoughts are not your thoughts, nor are your ways My ways,” declares the Lord. “For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are My ways higher than your ways and My thoughts than your thoughts.”* – Isaiah 55:8‑9  
- **Observation** – As a human, I’m limited in what I know and how I can act. God is not limited in any way. He sees and knows everything.  
- **Application** – Since God knows everything and His ways are best, I’ll have more success in life if I follow Him instead of relying on my own way.  
- **Prayer** – *Lord, I don’t know how to live a good life that pleases You and helps others. My ways lead to mistakes. My thoughts hurt. Please teach me Your ways and thoughts instead. Let your Holy Spirit guide me as I follow You.*  
- **Sharing** – I will share these verses and this application with my friend, Steve, who is going through a difficult time and needs direction for important decisions he’s facing.

### Accountability Groups

Jesus said – “From everyone who has been given much, much will be demanded; and from the one who has been entrusted with much, much more will be asked.”

Jesus shared many stories of accountability and told us many truths about how we will be held responsible for what we do and say. Jesus tells us these things now so we can be ready later. And because we will be accountable to Him one day, it’s good to practice being accountable to one another now.

**Accountability Groups** are made up of two or three people of the same gender – men with men, women with women – who meet once a week to discuss a set of questions that help reveal areas where things are going right and other areas that need correction.

Every follower of Jesus will be held accountable, so every follower should practice accountability with others.
