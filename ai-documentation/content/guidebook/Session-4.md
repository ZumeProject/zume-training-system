### Three‑Minute Testimony

Jesus told His followers – “You are witnesses of these things.” As followers of Jesus, we are “witnesses,” too – “testifying” about the impact Jesus has had on our lives. Your story of your relationship with God is called your testimony. Everybody has a story. This is a chance to practice yours.

Choose one or two followers to practice with and then pick 5 names from your List of 100. Make sure you choose people in the category “non‑Christian” or “unknown spiritual status.” Practice your testimony – your story of Jesus – by having your practice partners pretend to be 1 of the 5 people you chose from your list. Practice shaping your story to make it specific for each of the 5. You should be able to share a short version of your story in about three minutes.

There are endless ways to shape your story, but here are some ways that we’ve seen work well with others:  

- **You can share a simple statement about why you chose to follow Jesus.** This works well for a brand new believer.  
- **You can share your “before” and “after” story** – what your life was like before you knew Jesus and what your life is now. Simple and powerful.  
- **You can share your “with” and “without” story** – what your life is like “with Jesus” and what it would be like “without Him.” This version of your story works well if you came to faith at a young age.  

When sharing your story, it’s helpful to think of it as part of a three‑part process:

1. **Their story** – Ask the person you are talking with to share about their spiritual journey.  
2. **Your story** – Then share your testimony shaped around their experience.  
3. **God’s story** – Finally share God’s story in a way that connects with their worldview, values and priorities.  

And if you’re worried about how to get started – keep it simple. Just share a statement of why you decided to follow Jesus. God can use your story to change lives, but remember – you’re the one who gets to tell it.

Your Three‑Minute Testimony is another simple tool in the Zúme Toolkit.

## Activity (30 min)

### Practice sharing your testimony

- Work on writing out your story and keeping it to only three minutes. (10 min)  
- Break into groups of two to three and practice sharing. (20 min)

#### Three Basic Kinds of Testimonies

There are endless ways to shape your story, but here are some ways that we’ve seen work well:

- **A Simple Statement** – You can share a simple statement about why you chose to follow Jesus. This works well for a brand new believer.  
- **Before and After** – You can share your “before” and “after” story – what your life was like before you knew Jesus and what your life is now. Simple and powerful.  
- **With and Without** – You can share your “with” and “without” story – what your life is like “with Jesus” and what it would be like “without Him.” This version of your story works well if you came to faith at a young age.  

#### Three Parts to Sharing Your Testimony

When sharing your story, it’s helpful to think of it as part of a three‑part process:

1. **Their Story** – Ask the person you are talking with to share about their spiritual journey.  
2. **Your Story** – Then share your testimony shaped around their experience.  
3. **God’s Story** – Finally share God’s story in a way that connects with their worldview, values and priorities.  

Your testimony doesn’t have to be lengthy or share too many details to be impactful. In fact, keeping your story to around 3‑minutes will leave time for questions and deeper conversation. If you’re worried about how to get started – keep it simple. God can use your story to change lives, but remember – you’re the one who gets to tell it.

### Great – Greater – Greatest Blessings

In this session, we’ll talk about God’s **GREAT**, **GREATER** and **GREATEST BLESSINGS** and how you can share them with others. When someone chooses to follow Jesus, how do you help them move down the right path? How do you help them become a producer in God’s kingdom and not just another consumer? How do you help them receive all the blessings that God is willing to give?

I start by telling them this…

- It is a blessing to follow Jesus.  
- It is a great blessing to lead others to follow Jesus.  
- It is a greater blessing to start a new spiritual family.  
- It is the greatest blessing to equip others to start new spiritual families.

You have chosen to follow Jesus and so God has blessed you. I want you to have God’s great blessing, greater blessing and greatest blessing, too. Can I show you how?

If they want to know more, I ask them to make a list of 100 people they already know. Then I ask them to choose five people from that list – five people who do not know Jesus – five people they want to share with right away.

It is a blessing to follow Jesus. Who else do you want to share this blessing with?  
I teach them to share their **TESTIMONY** – the story of what God is doing in their life. I teach them to share the **GOSPEL** – the story of what God is doing in the world. I teach them how to share about God’s great, greater and greatest blessings.

I have them practice these things one time for each of the five people they’ve chosen to share with. First their story. Then God’s story. Then God’s blessings. Each time, I pretend to be one of the five people from their list. Each time, they share their story. They share God’s story. They invite me to become a follower of Jesus, too. I teach about God’s great, greater and greatest blessing. Each time, I ask them questions or make comments that I think that person might make. After we’ve practiced, I ask to meet them again – just two days later if possible – to see how this sharing is going.

I want to give them enough time to meet with the five from their list, but I don’t want to give so much time that they put it off or forget.  
I always ask for a phone number or email address or another way to keep in touch. I pray with them that God will give the right words just as they’ve shared with me.

Two days later, we meet again and talk about how the sharing is going. If they haven’t shared, I offer to practice with them more. I offer to go with them right then to any of the five who might be available. I do everything I can to help them begin sharing. But I won’t talk about new things. I want to give them the best opportunity to be faithful with what they’ve already learned.

If they refuse or make excuses, I ask God if this is really “good soil” that will be fruitful for His kingdom or if there is somewhere else where I should be investing.  

If they shared – we celebrate!  
Even if none on their list believed, I’m excited that they **HEARD**, **OBEYED** and **SHARED**. That’s being faithful. And since they’ve been faithful with a little, I’m glad to share more.

I share about **BAPTISM** and give them another tool they can use like ___ or ___.

Ask them to choose some other people from their list of 100 – people who don’t know or don’t follow Jesus.  
And then I practice with them – just like before – with their story, with God’s story and with the blessings. And we pray.  

Now if they shared AND someone on their list believed, we really **CELEBRATE!**  
God’s family is getting bigger! I always ask if they shared about the great, greater and greatest blessing, because this is what keeps God’s family growing.

If they didn’t share about God’s blessings, we go over it again – the blessings, how a new follower of Jesus can make a list, how they can share their story, share God’s story and share the blessings – all so that new follower of Jesus can learn to share, too.

After we’ve practiced, I send them back to that new believer so they can continue sharing. But what about those who have shared AND someone on their list believed AND they shared the blessings?  
When that happens I am **OVERJOYED**.

This person is what God’s word calls “good soil” – someone who may grow God’s family in ways that are greater than I’ve ever seen! Whenever I find someone like this, I make plans to meet with them often. I invest heavily in their spiritual development.

I share new lessons like **BAPTISM** and how to start a **THREE‑THIRDS GROUP**. Now they can begin to grow a spiritual family – starting with those same new followers of Jesus.

Since they are so faithful, I’m excited to share as much as I can and see what God does next. Always a step at a time. Always giving them a chance to **LEARN, OBEY and SHARE** what they know.

I also pray for this person – as often as I can – thanking God for allowing me to share and learn with them and always asking Him to give them His **GREATEST BLESSING**.

## Discuss (10 min)

- Is this the pattern you were taught when you first began to follow Jesus? If not, what was different?  
- After you came to faith, how long was it before you began to disciple others?  
- What do you think would happen if new followers started sharing and discipling others, immediately?

### Duckling Discipleship

Welcome back to Zúme Training. In this session, we’ll learn how a brood of ducklings just learning to waddle can help us understand two of the most important principles of disciple‑making.

Have you ever seen a group of ducklings out for a walk?  
No matter where you are in the world, it always looks the same. A Mother Duck leads and her ducklings follow – one by one – all in a row. The Mother Duck leads. The little ducks follow.

But if you look even closer, you’ll see something else is happening, too. Each little duckling is actually playing two roles – at exactly the same time.

- **Each little duckling is a FOLLOWER**, because it’s following the Mother Duck or another duckling that’s walking right in front of it.  
- **And, at exactly the same time – Each little duckling is a LEADER**, because it’s leading the duckling (or ducklings) that’s walking right behind it.

So is the duckling a FOLLOWER or a LEADER? It’s both. And that’s why ducks “out for a walk” have everything to do with making disciples.

God wants His family to grow far – and so He expects every follower to be a leader, every believer to be a sharer, and every disciple to be a disciple‑maker – at exactly the same time.

One of the traps we fall into, as disciples and disciple‑makers, is the false belief that we have to know everything, or even just a lot of things, before we share anything. But that’s not how discipleship works.

Disciples are like ducklings. To be a leader, they don’t have to know everything. They just have to be one step ahead. God wants His family to grow in faithfulness – and so He expects every leader to be a follower, every sharer to be a believer, and every disciple‑maker to be a disciple – at exactly the same time, too.

Another trap we fall into, as disciples and disciple‑makers, is the false belief that someone, somewhere knows everything and if we just find and follow them, then we’re set. But that’s not how discipleship works, either.

In God’s Kingdom, there’s only one “Mother Duck” that all of us follow – and that’s Jesus Christ. No missionary. No pastor. No seminary professor. Only Jesus deserves the full measure of our faith.

The rest of us are “in process.” There will always be someone closer to Jesus that we can follow. And there will always be someone further away that we can lead. But no matter our position, our eyes – and our hearts – should always be fully fixed on Jesus. In the Bible, Paul, who wrote much of the New Testament and started many of the first churches, didn’t just write – “Follow me.” He wrote, “Follow me, as I follow Christ.” Paul knew what ducklings everywhere know and what every disciple should know, too – every leader in God’s Kingdom has to be a follower – and all of us follow Jesus.

In the Bible, Paul also wrote: “What you have heard from me… share with faithful men, who will be able to teach others, too.”  
Paul knew what ducklings everywhere know and what every disciple should know, too. Every follower in God’s Kingdom has to be a leader – and all of us should lead like Jesus, laying down our lives for others.

If you want to see God’s family grow far and grow in faithfulness, then think of disciple‑making like ducklings – become a follower and a leader at exactly the same time.

### Eyes to See Where the Kingdom Isn’t

In this session, we’ll learn how disciples multiply far and fast when they start to see where God’s Kingdom isn’t.

As humans, we think about, focus on and work for things that we can see. We call it reality – the way things are. The way they’re. But the kingdom grows more quickly when we focus on things we can’t see – things that aren’t there. Or things that aren’t there, yet.

There are places all around us where God’s will is not being done on earth as it is in heaven – giant gaps where brokenness, pain, persecution, suffering and even death are a part of normal, everyday life.

Every disciple – every follower of Jesus – needs to be able to see not just where God’s Kingdom is, but where God’s kingdom isn’t. Kingdom work is about entering into those gaps and into those dark places and working to close the chasms and bring light and life during our time here on earth.

We can see where God’s Kingdom isn’t in two ways – through people we already know and through people we haven’t yet met.

The first way is **through people we already know** – our ONGOING RELATIONSHIPS of friends and family, coworkers, classmates, neighbors and more. This is the way God’s Story travels FASTEST. We love and care about these people because we know them already. It’s natural.

Jesus told a story of a selfish rich man – arrogant in life and now being punished in hell. The rich man begged – “send Lazarus to my father’s home. Let him warn my five brothers, so they won’t come to this horrible place.”

Jesus showed us how even the selfish and suffering have some love and concern for those close to them.

The people we know are placed in our lives because God loves us and wants us to love them. We need to be good stewards of those relationships with love, patience and persistence. Disciples multiply when they’re concerned for the people God’s placed around them and they have a plan to do something about it.

You can help increase their care and build a simple plan to multiply in just a few steps. Here’s how – have them write a list of 100 people they already know. Have them break that list into three categories.

- Those who follow Jesus.  
- Those who don’t follow Jesus.  
- Those who they’re not sure whether they follow or not.

For the followers – disciples can equip and encourage them to be more fruitful and faithful.  
For the non‑followers – disciples can learn how to share and introduce them to a loving God.  
For those who they’re not sure – disciples can learn to invest their time and learn more.

There’s also a way we see where God’s Kingdom isn’t through people we haven’t met. These are people OUTSIDE OUR RELATIONSHIPS – people we don’t know, neighbors we’ve never said more than “hello” to, businessmen and women we pass on the street, strangers in every village, town or city we’ve never even visited, yet.

Jesus said – make disciples of all nations. Jesus said – you will tell everyone about me in Jerusalem, in all Judea, in Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.

Sharing with people we know is the way God’s Story travels FASTEST. Sharing with people we don’t know yet is the way God’s Story travels FARTHEST.

If we love and care about those we don’t know, that’s not natural. It’s supernatural and evidence of the Holy Spirit at work in our lives. God’s favorites are the least, the last and the lost. These are the ones He pours out His heart to over and over again.

If we want to be like God, then these are the ones we have to invest our lives in. God commands us to go. And part of going is to go not just to those who are close by but also to those who live in the spiritually darkest corners of the world – people who sometimes have never even heard the name, Jesus.

God’s Word says – God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble. As followers of Jesus we must give grace as He gives it – to the humble, to the desperate and to the lost. Disciples multiply when they’re concerned for the people God’s placed in their lives. Disciples multiply even more when they’re concerned for the people God’s placed nowhere near them. But even then they still need a plan.

You can help increase a disciple’s care for others and build a simple plan to multiply by training them to look for the people God’s already prepared to hear. Jesus said – As soon as you enter a home, say, “God bless this home with peace.” If the people living there are peace‑loving, your prayer for peace will bless them. But if they are not peace‑loving, your prayer will return to you.

We call someone who God has already prepared to hear a PERSON OF PEACE – someone responsive to God’s message and faithful in OBEYING and SHARING with others. In a place where we know very few, instead of sharing with our friends, families, co‑workers, classmates and neighbors, we train a person of peace how to reach theirs.

But the best results always come when we focus on the faithful. Remember faithfulness is demonstrated by OBEYING what God tells us and SHARING it with others. Faithful people don’t have hard hearts that reject God’s Word. Faithful people don’t fall away when they’re persecuted or when times get hard. Faithful people aren’t distracted by the worries of this world or riches that don’t last. Faithful people are like the demon‑possessed man in the Gerasenes who obeyed and shared what Jesus showed him. One faithful man who obeyed and shared produced many, many people who wanted to know Jesus more.

Opening our eyes to see where the Kingdom isn’t and reaching out through people we know and people we don’t know yet is how disciples multiply and God’s Kingdom grows far and fast.

## Discuss (10 min)

- Who are you more comfortable sharing with – people you already know or people you haven’t met, yet?  
- Why do you think that is?  
- How could you get better at sharing with people you’re less comfortable with?

### The Lord’s Supper

Jesus said – “I am the living bread that came down from heaven. Whoever eats this bread will live forever. This bread is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.”  

Holy Communion or “The Lord’s Supper” is a way to celebrate our intimate connection and ongoing relationship with Jesus.

Here’s a simple way to celebrate —

When you gather as followers of Jesus, spend time in quiet meditation, silently considering and confessing your sins. Have someone read this passage from scripture – “For I received from the Lord that which I also delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus in the night in which He was betrayed took bread; and when He had given thanks, He broke it and said, “This is My body, which is for you; do this in remembrance of Me.” (1 Corinthians 11:23‑24)

Pass out bread you have set aside for your group and eat.

Continue the reading – “In the same way, He took the cup also after supper, saying, ‘This cup is the new covenant in My blood; do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of Me.’” (1 Corinthians 11:25)

Share the juice or wine you have set aside for your group and drink.

Finish the reading – “For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord’s death until He comes.” (1 Corinthians 11:26)

You have shared in The Lord’s Supper.

Celebrate in prayer or singing – you are His and He is yours!
