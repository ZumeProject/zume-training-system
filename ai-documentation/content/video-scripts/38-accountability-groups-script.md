# (38) Accountability Groups Script

**URL:** https://zume.training/en/app/script?s=38

Jesus said - "From everyone who has been given much, much will be demanded; and from the one who has been entrusted with much, much more will be asked."

Jesus shared many stories of accountability and told us many truths of how we will be held responsible for what we do and say.

Jesus tells us these things now, so we can be ready for later. And because we will be accountable to him one day, it's good to practice being accountable to one another now.

Accountability Groups are made up of two or three people of the same gender - men with men, women with women - who meet once a week to discuss a set of questions that help reveal areas where things are going right and other areas that need correction.

Every follower of Jesus will be held accountable, so every follower of Jesus should practice accountability with others.

Accountability Groups. Another simple tool in the ZÃºme Toolkit.
