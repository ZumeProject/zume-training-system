Jesus said - "Go and make disciples…" And His followers did just that.

They went to their family. They went to their friends. They went to people they knew in town. They went to people they worked with. They went.

Jesus said "Go" and they obeyed. And God's family grew.

God has already given us the relationships we need to "Go and make disciples." These are our family, friends, neighbors, co-workers and classmates - people we've known all our lives, people we've just met.

Being faithful with the people God has already put in our lives is a great first step in multiplying disciples. And it can start with the simple step of making a list.

A List of 100 is a simple tool in the Zúme Toolkit that multiplies disciples.
