# Four Fields Tool

The **Four Fields Diagnostic Chart** is a simple tool used by a leadership cell to reflect on the status of current efforts and the Kingdom activity around them. Jesus often pulled the disciples back, away from ministry to quieter places, to review how the work was going. This tool helps you and your co-leaders follow Jesus' pattern and address all parts of your stewardship.

Use the tool in peer mentoring to review activity, people, and groups by categorizing them into the different fields. Ask each other core questions to surface points of action and determine next steps.
