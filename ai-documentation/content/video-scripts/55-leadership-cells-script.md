# (55) Leadership Cells Script

**URL:** https://zume.training/en/app/script?s=55

In this session, we'll learn how LEADERSHIP CELLS prepare followers in a short time to become leaders for a lifetime.

One becomes two. Two becomes four. Four becomes eight. Individual multiplication. Generational increase. Exponential growth. This is the model God built into His creation. This is the way God intends His family to grow. We've already learned the 3/3rds pattern that turns consumers into producers, learners into leaders and disciples into disciple-makers.

Look Back - Look Up - Look Forward. Learn - Obey - Share.

This way of meeting together produces ongoing spiritual growth in individual believers and ongoing reproductive growth in a group of followers of Jesus. This pattern helps disciples multiply.

But what if a group is together for only a short period of time? Can they still grow and reproduce God's Kingdom? Leadership Cells are a way to put the 3/3rds pattern to work when you know there's a limit to how long a group can be together.

Leadership Cells equip individual believers in a short time to learn reproductive patterns that last a lifetime.

Leadership Cells help learners become leaders who will then start new groups, train new churches, and begin more Leadership Cells to grow God's family.

Leadership Cells work well when a group is mobile. Nomads, students, military personnel, seasonal workers who already follow Jesus work great in a Leadership Cell. Because of their culture, their profession or their season of life - they may have a hard time establishing an ongoing group, but they can absolutely be trained how to start groups in each place they travel.

Leadership Cells also work well when a group of people come to faith at the same time. A family, a network of friends, or even a small village can be trained in a short time to become producers for a lifetime - even without individual follow-ups or spiritual coaching.

In an earlier session, we learned and practiced the last two parts of the 3/3rds pattern. Now will practice the entire pattern -- all three parts -- looking back, looking up, looking forward.
