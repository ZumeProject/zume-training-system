Jesus often taught His followers about the purpose, the practice and the promises of prayer.

Jesus said - "Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you. For everyone who asks receives; he who seeks finds; and to him who knocks, the door will be opened."

Jesus taught His followers that prayer isn't for public praise, a selfish wishlist or a rambling speech we repeat over and over again.

Jesus showed us prayer has power because it's a direct and ongoing conversation with our Father in heaven who loves us. Like any good conversation, a good prayer means both sides get to listen -- and speak. But speaking to the God who created the universe can seem intimidating. And actually hearing something back - well for most people that can be downright scary.

The good news is that getting better at prayer - having better and deeper conversations with a God who loves us - is not only possible - it's exactly what God wants.

But when prayer feels like learning a new language - how do you get better? The answer is simple - you practice. The Prayer Cycle is a simple tool for practicing prayer that you can use by yourself and share with any follower.

In just 12 simple steps - 5 minutes each - the Prayer Cycle guides you through twelve ways the Bible teaches us to pray. At the end, you'll have prayed for an hour. The Bible tells us -- "Pray without ceasing." Not many of us can say we do that. But after this hour of prayer - you'll be a step closer.
