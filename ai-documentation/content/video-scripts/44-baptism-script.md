# (44) Baptism Script

**URL:** https://zume.training/en/app/script?s=44

Jesus said -- "go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit…"

Baptism - or "Baptizo" in the original language - means a drenching or submerging - like when you dye a cloth and it soaks in the color and comes out transformed.

Baptism is a picture of our new life, soaked in the image of Jesus, transformed in obedience to God. It is a picture of our death to sin, just as Jesus died for our sins; a burial of our old way of life, just as Jesus was buried; a rebirth to a new life in Christ, just as Jesus was resurrected and lives today.

If you have never baptized someone before, it may seem intimidating, but it shouldn't be. Here are some simple steps. Find some standing water, deep enough to allow the new disciple to be submerged. This could be a pond, river, lake or ocean. It could be a bathtub or another way to gather water.

Let the disciple hold one of your hands with theirs and support their back with the other.

Ask two questions like these to make sure they understand their decision.

"Do you believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God and that He died for your sins and rose from the dead?"
"Will you obey and serve Him as your King for the rest of your life?"

If they answer "Yes," to both, then say something like this:

"Because you've professed your faith in the Lord Jesus, I now baptize you in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit."

Help them lower into the water, submerge completely and raise them back up.

You've baptized a new follower of Jesus - a new citizen of heaven - a new child of the Living God. It's time to celebrate!

Baptism - the first sacrament Jesus gave His followers and a foundation of the Zúme Toolkit.
