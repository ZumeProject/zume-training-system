# The Lord’s Supper and How To Lead It

Jesus said - “I am the living bread that came down from heaven. Whoever eats this bread will live forever. This bread is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.”

Holy Communion or “The Lord’s Supper” is a way to celebrate our intimate connection and ongoing relationship with Jesus.

Here’s a simple way to celebrate —

When you gather as followers of Jesus, spend time in quiet meditation, silently considering and confessing your sins.

Have someone read this passage from scripture -- “For I received from the Lord that which I also delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus in the night in which He was betrayed took bread; and when He had given thanks, He broke it and said, “This is My body, which is for you; do this in remembrance of Me.” (1 Corinthians 11:23-24)

Pass out bread you have set aside for your group and eat.

Continue the reading -- “In the same way, He took the cup also after supper, saying, ‘This cup is the new covenant in My blood; do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of Me.’” (1 Corinthians 11:25)

Share the juice or wine you have set aside for your group and drink.

Finish the reading -- "For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord’s death until He comes.” (1 Corinthians 11:26)

You have shared in The Lord’s Supper.

Celebrate in prayer or singing - you are His and He is yours!
