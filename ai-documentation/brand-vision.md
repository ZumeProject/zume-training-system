## 10 Challenges Facing Disciple Making and Church Planting That Zúme Training Addresses (Soft, Simple Language List)

### 1. **Lack of Clear Understanding of Basic Concepts**
- **Challenge**: Many believers don't have a clear, simple understanding of what it means to be a disciple or what constitutes a church
- **Zúme Solution**: Provides "Simple Definition of Disciple and Church" teaching that clarifies these foundational concepts

### 2. **Complexity Barriers to Church Planting**
- **Challenge**: Traditional church models are complex and difficult to multiply
- **Zúme Solution**: Teaches "Simple Church" concepts that are easy to start and reproduce, focusing on what's essential rather than institutional structures

### 3. **Lack of Practical Skills and Training**
- **Challenge**: Most believers lack practical training in how to actually make disciples and plant churches
- **Zúme Solution**: Offers 32 practical concepts and skills with hands-on exercises, moving beyond knowledge to competence through practice-oriented training

### 4. **Limited Access to Training**
- **Challenge**: Many people can't access quality disciple-making training due to geographic, financial, or scheduling barriers
- **Zúme Solution**: Provides free, multilingual, self-facilitated training that can be done anytime, anywhere with groups of 3-12 people

### 5. **Slow Multiplication and Pace**
- **Challenge**: Traditional discipleship approaches are too slow to reach the world in our generation
- **Zúme Solution**: Teaches "Non-Sequential Growth" and emphasizes that "Pace of Multiplication Matters" - showing how multiple things can happen simultaneously rather than linearly

### 6. **Lack of Vision for Saturation**
- **Challenge**: Most believers and churches lack a clear vision for reaching entire populations and geographic areas
- **Zúme Solution**: Casts vision for "saturating the world with multiplying disciples" with specific goals (1 trained disciple maker per 5,000 people in North America, 1 per 50,000 globally)

### 7. **Inadequate Leadership Development**
- **Challenge**: There's a shortage of leaders who can train other leaders
- **Zúme Solution**: Teaches "Training Cycle for Maturing Disciples" and "Peer Mentoring Groups" to develop leaders who make leaders

### 8. **Difficulty Finding and Engaging Seekers**
- **Challenge**: Many believers struggle to identify receptive people and engage effectively with non-believers
- **Zúme Solution**: Teaches concepts like "Person of Peace" strategy and provides tools for "Engaging Seekers" and "Sharing God's Story"

### 9. **Weak Spiritual Foundation and Practices**
- **Challenge**: New believers often lack strong spiritual foundations for growth and reproduction
- **Zúme Solution**: Teaches "Spiritual Breathing" (hearing and obeying God), "S.O.A.P.S. Bible Reading," prayer practices, and other spiritual disciplines

### 10. **Lack of Ongoing Accountability and Support**
- **Challenge**: Many discipleship efforts fail due to lack of sustained accountability and encouragement
- **Zúme Solution**: Provides tools like "Three-Month Plan," "Generational Mapping" for tracking progress, and emphasizes building networks of connected simple churches for ongoing support

### Zúme's Comprehensive Approach

Zúme addresses these challenges through:
- **32 concepts and skills** taught over 20 hours of training
- **Group-based learning** (3-12 people) with discussion and practice
- **Action-oriented sessions** that end with practical steps
- **Free, accessible format** available in 45+ languages
- **Simple tools** that ordinary people can use effectively
- **Vision for movements** rather than just individual growth

The core philosophy is that "God uses ordinary people doing simple things to make a big impact," making disciple-making and church planting accessible to everyone rather than just trained professionals.
